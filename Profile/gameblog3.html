          <h4 class="BalatroText">Background:</h4>

          <p>
            Balatro is a roguelike and self-described hypnotically satisfying deck builder. 
            In Balatro you play poker hands to accumulate enough score to beat enemy blinds in the form of chips and mult. 
            These hands and scores are remixed using the game's various card/deck enhancements, game changing jokers and passive vouchers. 
            Using all these tricks, you can perform combos to accumulate the score needed to progress.
          </p>

          <h4 class="BalatroText">Gameplay:</h4>

          <p>
            Balatro's consists of a gameplay loop split up into two distinct parts. 
            Part one is scoring against blinds. Blinds act as scoring goals, where exceeding their score wins you the round. 
            You earn score by playing poker hands. Each hand has a base amount of chips and mult, with additional score coming 
            from various jokers and deck enhancements. Your chips are multiplied by mult to calculate score. Money is earned after 
            each round before entering the second part, the shop. In the shop you can spend money to enhance cards and purchase 
            jokers which influence your runs.

            <p>
              This forms Balatro's gameplay loop. What makes this cycle so infectiously addicting is the audio and visual 
              design of the game. Balatro is loaded with animations and sound effects that create the hypnotic feeling often 
              associated with the game. These effects range from either obvious to very slight details that most wouldn't notice 
              without close inspection. These are layered to create the game's rhythm which leads to the addictive feeling.
            </p>

            <h4 class="BalatroText">Visuals:</h4>

            <h5 class="BalatroText">Passive animations:</h5>

            <p>
              The defining trait of the game's visuals that enhance its addictive and hypnotic feeling is the movement of the 
              game's elements. Most of the elements on screen at any given moment are not static. They move ever so slightly. 
              These animations are independent of player action and happen passively while playing. Cards sway slowly. 
              Letters in text bounce up and down slightly. UI elements such as buttons subtly shift in place. 
              The background is constantly swirling/pulsing. Vouchers and booster packs have a foil texture which produces a 
              moving sheen from the swaying motion. The boss blind icons also have a reflective sheen animation. The CRT scanline 
              filter produces movement along the borders of UI elements. These are all low-frequency, subtle animations that create 
              a calm and soothing feeling for the player. They also give the game world a sense of breathing and make all the elements 
              feel alive. 
            </p>

            <h5 class="BalatroText">Active animations:</h5>

            <p>
              While the passive animations are low-frequency and soothing, animations related to player action are quick and snappy. 
              These are designed to grab the players attention and provide feedback, making your actions feel deliberate and impactful. 
              Hovering over a card will make it jump before rotating based on cursor position. 
              Cards that are played snap into place. Cards that are discarded are flung off screen. 
              Cards fill up your hand from the deck by sliding in and flipping around. Menus that slide in slightly overshoot 
              their target and snap back into position. When jokers or cards give chips and mult they pulse quickly. 
              Items bought from the shop rapidly move to their locations. Before being opened, booster packs shake before 
              bursting open to reveal their contents. When your hand has enough score to defeat the boss blind in one shot, 
              the score indicators catch on fire, with the fire growing in intensity based on the score. 
              These animations are energetic and provide a contrast to the soothing passive animations. 
              This flow between slow calming animations and snappy energetic animations creates the hypnotic rhythm that makes the 
              gameplay loop so addicting.
            </p>

            <h4 class="BalatroText">Sounds:</h4>

            <p>
              The sound design in Balatro is also what creates the addictive feeling in its gameplay. Much like the animations there 
              are more subtle sounds and sharper and tactile sounds. The looping electronic jazz/lo-fi background music is used to 
              lull the player into a trance, providing a similar relaxing effect to the passive animations. The song has slight 
              variations that it eases in and out of depending on the situation. Clicking buttons give off a faint click sound. 
              Hovering over buttons and cards produces a subtle sound that makes scrolling through menus more satisfying. The screen 
              transitions make a “woosh” effect. These contrast with the more active sound elements which, like their animation 
              counterparts are designed to grab player attention and provide feedback. The sound of cards from the deck filling up 
              your hand gives them a more physical/tactile feeling. When cards and jokers activate, there's an accompanying ding. 
              Your money being spent or collected has a sharp coin sound effect. Playing and discarding cards has a slight snap. 
              When your score is on fire, there's a burning sound that grows in intensity with the animation. This flow between 
              soothing and energetic sounds, like the animations, is responsible for the rhythm in the game.
            </p>

            <h4 class="BalatroText">Conclusion:</h4>

            <p>
              Balatro's addictive nature isn't created with high intensity gameplay, but rather carefully considered 
              design choices regarding its visual and audio design. Creating a flow between soft and soothing animations 
              and energetic and snappy ones. A flow between calming sounds and sharper ones.
