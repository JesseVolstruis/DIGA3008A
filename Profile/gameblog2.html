            <h4 class="DiceyText">Background:</h4>

            <p>
              Dicey dungeons is a turn-based roguelike deck builder like Slay the Spire. 
              In the game, you play as a giant walking dice as part of a gameshow. In this show you progress through a dungeon, 
              battling enemies and collecting equipment. Once in combat, at the start of each turn, a varying number of dice are 
              rolled that can be used to activate your equipment (for both you and the enemy). The dice values determine how the 
              equipment is used. You choose from six characters which determine the rules and how you play.
            </p>

            <h4 class="DiceyText">Randomness:</h4>

            <p>
              Randomness can refer to elements, systems, and/or interactions that are unpredictable. 
              This unpredictability has many uses in games. One use is variety. Randomness can be used to create games with 
              a large quantity of varied content (such as Minecraft's infinite worlds), whereas the same quantity couldn't be 
              achieved by hand crafting this content. This almost endless amount of unique content can make games more replayable 
              (able to be experienced more than once). In roguelikes like Dicey Dungeons, new content is generated each time you 
              start a run. This prevents players from memorizing a single level and instead forces them to learn the underlying 
              systems and mechanics in the game. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="DiceyText">Types of randomness:</h4>

            <p>
              Randomness in games is often separated into two types: Input randomness and output randomness. 
              Input refers to randomness occurring before the player makes a decision, with output occurring after 
              making a decision. Players tend to think that output randomness is inherently more unfair than input randomness as 
              plans can be disrupted by random chance rather than a player's skill.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regarding Dicey Dungeons, an example of input randomness would be the layout of the dungeon being 
              generated at the start of each run and your dice being rolled at the start of each turn. 
            </p>

            <p>
              An example of output randomness in Dicey Dungeons would be random side effects of some equipment 
              (although this very rarely done), enemy's dice being rolled after you end your turn, and the effects of the curse 
              which can cause equipment to fail after you use it. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="DiceyText">Strategy:</h4>

            <p>
              Even though the player's and enemy's actions are determined by dice rolls, 
              the game still feels fair, with strategy being integral to success. How Dicey Dungeons uses randomness 
              with strategy is by giving the player tools and knowledge to adapt to unpredictable outcomes. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="DiceyText">Player control:</h4>

            <p>
              Your actions are determined by dice rolls but there are various ways to control your actions. 
              The pool of equipment you can find in a run is determined by the character you play as, 
              which reduces the possibility of redundant equipment. Different equipment may have different dice requirements to 
              be used however, there are many pieces of equipment that let you manipulate the value of your dice rolls. 
              This allows you to take what was a disadvantageous dice roll and cater it to your current equipment. 
            </p>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog2_pic3.png" alt="Screenshot of equipment">
              <figcaption>Modifies your dice value</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog2_pic4.png" alt="Screenshot of equipment">
              <figcaption>Requires specific dice value</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              Players can also carry various types of equipment to get value out of as many dice rolls as possible. 
              The challenge is balancing powerful but risky strategies that rely on specific dice values, and safer 
              strategies with more consistency. You can also use methods such as status ailments to control the dice 
              values that enemies roll reducing the number of unknowns and further informing strategy, such as using the 
              freeze ailment to turn an enemy's highest dice values into a 1.
            </p>

            <h4 class="DiceyText">Information:</h4>

            <p>
              You do not encounter enemies randomly. You can view the map of a floor and plan out the order in which you 
              encounter enemies, pick up health restoration, and gather equipment.
            </p>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog2_pic5.png" alt="Screenshot of floor layout">
              <figcaption>Floor map</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              Enemy dice rolls are a form of output randomness as they occur after you end your turn and are 
              normally out of the players control however, the player is given information to plan around this unpredictability. 
              Although the rolls are random, you can see the equipment the enemy is using and the number of dice they roll each turn. 
              Enemy equipment is static per enemy type meaning that with enough experience players can plan around enemy equipment 
              before entering combat and navigate the map using this information. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The output randomness of enemy rolls and status ailments are used to add tension and prevent players 
              from planning out their strategy too many turns in advance. Unpredictable events are used to test players' 
              risk management skills, and how they can adapt to changing circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>
              In summary, input randomness influences player strategy and is made fair through giving the player enough control 
              of their options in combat, and output randomness either gives players enough information to inform their decisions 
              or is used to test the players risk management skills and adaptability.
            </p>

            <h4 class="DiceyText">Themes:</h4>

            <p>
              The game presents a scenario where characters that are turned into dice compete in a game show against Lady Luck. 
              The game show elements are used for the episodic format of the game. Each character has 6 episodes to complete, with 
              each having different rules and restrictions. Where randomness is utilized is the game's central theme. The theme of 
              dice and luck is intertwined with the gameplay loop of rolling dice to determine strategy. This randomness also 
              synergises with the roguelike aspect of the game, with randomly generated floor and enemy layouts providing the 
              variety necessary for the genre.
            </p>
