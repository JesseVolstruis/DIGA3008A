            <h4 class="CelesteText">Background:</h4>

            <p>
              Celeste is an indie 2D precision platformer that originally started as a game jam project. 
              It was later made into a full title. The game has you climb Celeste Mountain in the form of 7 chapters. 
              (9 if you include bonus content) Each chapter has the player progress through various platforming challenges as you 
              climb the mountain. Your main movement mechanics are movement, jumping, the ability to cling to and climb walls and 
              most importantly, a dash that functions in the 8 cardinal directions.
            </p>

            <h4 class="CelesteText">Level Structure:</h4>

            <p>
              Each chapter is distinct whether it be in visuals, narrative or chapter specific level elements, 
              each follow a broad structure. (a blueprint of sorts) In Celeste, each chapter is comprised of 
              individual screens that the player must solve. (overcome that screen's challenges and make it to the end) 
              A chapter's structure is like a story: Beginning: The player scopes out the level, familiarizes themselves 
              with its elements and themes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tension: A problem is presented for the player to solve
            </p>

            <p>
              Climax: A more difficult problem or an escalation of the previous one
            </p>

            <p>
              Resolution: a reward, whether that be progression or a collectible
            </p>

            <p>
              This could be as small as the structure for a single screen, with the introduction of a problem, 
              the player solving it, and progressing as a reward. It could also apply to the chapter as a whole, 
              with the introduction of a level element, increasingly difficult challenges involving it, and completing the 
              chapter as a resolution. It can also be used multiple times, such as each third of a chapter having its own beginning, 
              increase in tension and resolution. This structure is intertwined with narrative and gameplay. 
              (especially regarding difficulty)
            </p>

            <h4 class="CelesteText">Difficulty:</h4>

            <p>
              Celeste strikes a perfect balance with its difficulty. Not too easy as to bore the player, 
              but not too challenging to frustrate them. How this is achieved is by balancing the length of a segment of 
              gameplay and how demanding that segment is. A challenge is less demanding if the player has less to keep track 
              of or less actions to take to avoid being killed. An example would be flat stable ground being considerably less 
              demanding than a piece of ground that disappears shortly after standing on it. It could also be the number of actions 
              needed for the challenge, such as a jump requiring either one dash or multiple in succession. 
            </p>

            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog1_pic2.png" alt="In game Celeste screenshot. More challenging screen">
              <figcaption>Player needs 2 dashes. A more demanding screen</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              The length of the screen plays a part as well. One way is stakes. The longer the screen, 
              the more progress is lost when you fail. Another way is vision. In smaller screens, the player 
              can see more of the problems they need to solve without moving. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Referring to the structure, a short screen with less demanding challenges is great for points of low tension. 
              The jumps are easy and there aren't many of them. This is typically used for level introductions or screens 
              where the player immediately applies what they've learned previously. Screens that are short but contain very 
              demanding jumps are great for increasing difficulty without becoming frustrating, or  are good for enforcing the 
              mechanics that are being taught in that chapter, acting as quick spikes in tension. The challenge is high but barely 
              any progress is lost on failure so the player can learn quicker. These are also used for optional content for players 
              that want more difficult challenges while not being mandatory for less skilled players. Long screens that use less 
              demanding jumps are great for testing what players have learned. A long series of simple jumps that feel very 
              satisfying when done correctly. This could also be used to created more stressful situations as more progress 
              is lost on death. These screens are usually the climax of a self-contained segment in the chapter. These are 
              all used in combination, creating rising and falling tension and challenge which creates the flow states players 
              can enter when playing the game. Achieving a balance in length and challenge is how Celeste achieves its satisfying 
              level of difficulty. This is supported by the creator, saying that screens that are hard to understand are easy to 
              execute and screens that are easy to understand are hard to execute.
            </p>

            <h4 class="CelesteText">Level elements:</h4>

            <p>
              What makes each chapter distinct (other than its narrative and visuals) 
              are chapter specific level elements. These are directly related the player's movement. 
              Some are based on movement, activating when the player does an action. Some directly alter how you 
              move such as a spring propelling you upwards or moving obstacles you need to time your movement to. 
              How these elements are used determines the problems the player needs to overcome. 
            </p>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog1_pic3.png" alt="In game screenshot of a traffic block">
              <figcaption>Traffic block in chapter 1. Rapidly moves along conveyer when you cling to or stand on it</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog1_pic4.png" alt="In game screenshot of dust bunnies">
              <figcaption>Dust bunnies in chapter 3. The black and red objects. Death on contact. Move on independent cycles and must be avoided.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog1_pic5.png" alt="In game screenshot of dash blocks">
              <figcaption>Dash blocks in chapter 5. Near instantly move along their paths when you dash and then slowly retreat.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              How Celeste uses these elements effectively is by squeezing as much out of each when it 
              comes to using them for problem solving. Looking at chapter 1's traffic blocks as an example, at 
              first you only need to use their direct movement to solve the problem. Later on, you need to use them their 
              movement for extra momentum for your jumps. The way the element works is not changed, only how you're using it.
            </p>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog1_pic6.png" alt="In game screenshot of easier screen">
              <figcaption>Early use. Just stand on the block and jump after it moves</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Blog1_pic7.png" alt="In game screenshot of harder screen">
              <figcaption>Must jump instantly after it moves to reach the other side.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              This is how Celeste creates a cycle of learning. You're introduced to an element, you learn how it works and 
              later you apply your understanding of these elements to solve multiple types of problems. What makes this 
              satisfying is that players can initially struggle to learn a mechanic however, once they do, successfully 
              applying your knowledge to solve problems makes players feel fulfilled and satisfied.
            </p>

            <h4 class="CelesteText">Narrative:</h4>

            <p>
              What makes Celeste's level design successful is how its linked to the narrative. 
              The overarching narrative is that the player character (Madeline) is challenging herself to climb a 
              mountain on a journey of self-discovery. The challenges in this journey are represented by the challenges 
              in the levels. The act of overcoming the platforming challenges is linked to climbing the mountain. 
              The challenging gameplay relates perseverance in the face of adversity to the various struggles with mental 
              health as the game's underlying themes are about anxiety and depression. The game also uses a more direct way of 
              linking these struggles to the gameplay in the form of Badeline: a reflection of the player character's struggles 
              in physical form that the player must confront.
