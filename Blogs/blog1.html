          <h3>Github:</h3>

          <p>
            Although I have a small bit of prior experience with Github, I am not
            familiar enough with how it works currently. Setting it up and
            publishing to pages was fairly simple and I'm excited for how my
            experience with Github will progress as I get more comfortable using
            it. It seems very useful, especially since I'm interested in game
            development. In order to increase my efficiency with collaborative
            coding and programming in general, it's best that I put in the proper
            effort to understand how Github works.

          <h3>Readings:</h3>
  
          <p><cite>The World-Wide Web </cite>By Berners-Lee et al.</p>
  
          <p>
            Reading this article gave me insight into the earlier developments of
            the world wide web as we know it. The web and its sites have become
            deeply ingrained in a lot of society and some people, myself included,
            can so easily take for granted how accessible the web and its
            information is. It's fascinating to me that despite how complex the
            Web is, it is so simple to navigate. In its early development the web
            seemed to be mostly focused on compiling human knowledge. The original
            vision for the web was for scientists to share documents after all.
            However, the web has grown significantly since then. Today, while also
            hosting a vast amount of human knowledge, the web is also used as
            sources of entertainment and communication. The web has grown from
            being knowledge-centric to being multipurpose and being relevant in
            many aspects of modern life. It's fascinating seeing the developments
            that were highly anticipated of the web in its early days, and seeing
            how many we have not only achieved, but surpassed, showing how we have
            advanced since the webs creation. The internet has greatly influenced
            my life, seeing as I use it very often for communication, education,
            and most predominantly entertainment. The dot com bubble While the
            dot-com bubble in many ways shaped the internet we experience today, I
            notice some parallels between this dot-com bubble and other bubbles we
            encounter online today such tech startups and crypto currencies. With
            crypto currency specifically I notice a similar focus on high
            valuations and hype-based cycles. The dot-com bubble also seems to
            have paved the way for tech giants such as Google and Amazon partly
            due to how they learned from the mistakes made during the dot-com era
            by focusing on sustainability rather than short term hype.

          <h3>Flash:</h3>
  
          <p>
            This was an interesting read considering how little I had known about
            Flash considering their past relevance on the internet and how
            ingrained into my life the internet is. It's fascinating seeing how
            the decline of Flash has led to an overall increase in security,
            performance and compatibility on the internet.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Goals for this course:</h3>
  
          <p>
            I would say my goals are to properly familiarize myself with Github.
            Since I plan on going into game development, collaborative coding is
            one of many things Github will help me with. Getting accustomed to it
            should benefit me. I also want to know more about the web, seeing as I
            spend a large amount of time on the internet and that it greatly
            impacts my life. I also want to become proficient with HTML and or
            Javascript as I think being proficient with them could be very
            beneficial for my future.
