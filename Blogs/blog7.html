        <h3>Close reading on internet geography:</h3>

        <p><cite>Greenstein et al.-2018-How Geography Shapes—and Is Shaped by—the Internet</cite> by Greenstein</p>

        <p>
            This article discusses the geographical implications of the internet and how its adoption and use impacted the economy. 
            More specifically how its reduction of transportation, communication and search costs affect the economy. 
            This supports the fact that the internet affects different locations in different ways depending on these factors.
        </p>

        <p>
            In its early days, the internet and knowledge about it spread rapidly. 
            As for its effect on the economy, 
            the internet appeared to reduce distance related frictions as distance creates a lot of frictions economically. 
            “However, because the strength of these frictions differs across places, the marginal impact of removing them will differ.” 
            I think what this means is that the frictions caused by distance varied between locations, and since 
            the internet would reduce these frictions, its effectiveness would differ depending on the location.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the specific frictions is communication cost. 
            “The cost of sending and receiving email and other forms of digital communication are the same, 
            irrespective of the distance between the sender and receiver.” 
            Essentially with the internet, the physical distance between people didn't matter. 
            There was less of a consequence for having to communicate with someone from a great distance because of this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another friction is transportation costs. The use of the internet lowered the costs of some services. 
            “Delivering physical newspapers to people's doors requires a costly operation to transport the physical object; 
            once digital infrastructure is in place, delivering digital news has almost zero marginal cost. “Another example 
            of this in more recent times would be E-books or digital media in general. With these goods/services available online 
            there is less need for transportation. One that ties into both transportation and distance is remote work, eliminating 
            the need to commute to work which is only possible through the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            The other friction is search costs which directly relates to the other two. 
            “If communication costs and transportation costs fall, then it is easier to compare potential choices before making a 
            selection.”  With the convenience the internet provides for these two costs, searching is made easier and its cost falls 
            as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is then discussed how these effects brought about by the internet “decrease the importance of geographical factors in 
            economic activity.” Essentially with distance, transportation and searching being less of an economical factor, 
            the need for firms and consumers to utilize the internet's technology changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            In relation to the “'death of distance model by Cairncross's (1997) book and Friedman's (2005) The World is Flat.” 
            “A key implication of these models is that cities become less important as the Internet diffuses” What I make of this 
            is that with transportation, communication and search costs reduced via the internet, physical location becomes 
            less relevant. With this, cities that benefitted from having lower costs in these areas have less of an advantage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Regarding its adoption and use “adoption of the Internet relies on complementary inputs. 
            “An example would be having the necessary expertise in IT systems. This expertise varies with location and 
            demonstrates the internet's varying geographical implications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, the benefits of and costs of internet adoption varies greatly with location. 
            “The net benefits of Internet-enabled frontier services are frequently higher in urban areas.” 
            This is because the internet has the potential to reduce the costs of transportation, communication, more than 
            it would in a rural area and because the internet would have a greater effect, it would have a greater net benefit. 
            This is also because the cost of adoption may be greater in more rural areas because of the lack of expertise or skilled 
            labour.
        </p>

        <p>
            Domain name registration and outsourcing services also heavily rely on geography. 
            “Domain names are typically only associated with the headquarters of multi-establishment firms, 
            which are disproportionately in larger cities (Aarland et al., 2007)” This further demonstrates the impact that 
            geography has on the internet and vice versa.
        </p>

        <p>
            Among individuals, there could still be variance in the adoption of the internet across more rural and more urban areas. 
            “Much of the urban-rural variance appears as a result of other factors that may be correlated with location, such as income, 
            age, and education.” These factors typically vary across different locations and since they impact the adoption of internet, 
            its adoption can vary across location. Although, due to dial-up ISPs quickly becoming a part of small markets there could be a 
            low fixed cost for entry.
        </p>

        <p>
            As far as the consequences for the diffusion of the internet on local economies, 
            “the Internet led to employment growth and wage gains in regions that have low populations and are economically isolated.” 
            I would agree. If the internet lowered communication, transportation and search costs, it would benefit locations where 
            those factors previously posed a problem. This would benefit regions that are not as prosperous. Although it could also be 
            said that it more so benefits communities that have more skilled individuals which would typically be people with already 
            high incomes.
        </p>

        <p>
            To further emphasize the fact that the internet typically benefits regions that are already well off: 
            “On average, the impact of advanced Internet investment on local wages is small and on employment is non-existent. 
            However, investment in the Internet is correlated with wage and employment growth in about 6 per cent of US counties, 
            representing 42 per cent of the US population.” These countries are already well off. Since the only noticeable increase 
            in wages was in already well-off countries, this showcases the geographical divide when it comes to the benefits of the 
            internet on the economy. The same can be seen with healthcare. Locations experienced with IT saw a lowering in cost while 
            the opposite was true for less experienced locations.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Lower communication costs may enable some industries like manufacturing to move out of cities. 
            However, innovative ideas-producing industries that involve frequent exchange of complex knowledge 
            will likely continue to rely on face-to-face interactions in cities.” Like above, the benefits of lowering costs are not 
            strictly positive. In this case the lowering of costs further reinforces practices that can't be reproduced with the 
            internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            “In particular, while invention became more geographically concentrated over this period, this is not true for the 
            counties that were leaders in business Internet adoption.” This is regarding the adoption of the internet and its 
            effect on innovation. The consensus is that it could be likened to the internet's effects on wages and productivity 
            but the increase in concentration of invention, it wasn't strictly for those with leaders in internet adoption. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, I would agree with the stance that the internet's use and effects can vary greatly depending on location 
            and geographical factors. This was true for the younger days of the internet but also holds relevance today. 
            Even today more rural and remote areas suffer from slower or less reliable internet due to less infrastructure. 
            Bigger companies (such as google or Netflix) have data centres primarily in major urban areas means that these major 
            cities see more benefits. On a slightly different note, the popularity of certain apps/services vary greatly depending 
            on location. An example would be WhatsApp being the dominant messaging platform on South Africa and Brazil whereas other 
            countries may use it way less. Certain media is only available in certain countries, needing a VPN to overcome this barrier. Countries with frequent natural disasters could have less stable internet infrastructure. These examples show how even today, the internet and its uses heavily depend on location and geography.
