      <h3>Reading:</h3>

      <p>
        <cite
          >You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media </cite
        >By Moulthrop, S.
      </p>

      <p>
        After reading this I find it interesting how, for the most part, the
        internet today can contrast the original vision for hypertext. I also
        find interesting how hypertext was intended to empower individuals by
        decentralizing knowledge, however it become dominated by large
        corporations such as CNN and Yahoo. This is similar to the internet
        today with companies such as Amazon and Google controlling most
        traffic. It's also fascinating to me how despite parts of the web
        contrasting the original vision for hypertext, hypertext being
        envisioned as an interactive media driven by users has some truth. An
        example is Wikipedia and social media in general where the users
        themselves supply most of the content. The concept of the “docuverse”
        being a connected decentralized space seemed to be true more so in the
        earlier days of the web with forums and blogs but over time has become
        more overrun with large platforms such as Google, Youtube, X (Twitter)
        that can limit information. Moulthrop suggests that we may not have
        created a true revolution in the media. I can agree to some degree. In
        today's internet social media algorithms determine what we see,
        leading to echo chambers and lessening discussion. I would argue that
        this does not line up with the revolution that is discussed. Overall,
        it was an interesting read. I found it fascinating how the web has
        shifted from being so focused on sharing information to more
        controlled environments.

      <h3>Folder structure:</h3>

      <p>
        My goal for my folder structure is to follow conventions to keep
        things organized and easy to access. I would say I keep my folders
        fairly organized, and I don't plan on changing that. It's also best to
        keep to conventions as it will be very useful when going into
        industry. It will undoubtedly be helpful when working with others in
        collaborative spaces. I also plan to keep my URL schemes similarly
        simple and organized, as well as following the best practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Wireframe:</h3>

        <img class="SubPageImage"
          src="Images/Wireframe_0.png"
          alt="Wireframe 0: Early home page concept"
        />
      
      <p>
        My plan is for a fairly simple design that's easily readable and
        navigable. Rather than a flashy or extravagant design, I intend to
        focus on simply displaying the important information front and center.
        The banner will most likely be an introduction or the purpose of the
        site. The four buttons in the center will direct you to the
        corresponding section while the buttons along the bottom allow you to
        navigate to any section regardless of the current page you're on.
        Nothing else is planned as I don't want to over complicate anything at
        the current moment.
      </p>

      <h3>Inspirational sites:</h3>

      <p>
        My main inspirations at the current moment have come from the work of
        past students, that way I can more easily identify the relevant
        information to put on my site. In the future I plan to look at
        portfolios and CVs of people in the game development industry and
        identify anything else relevant to my site.
