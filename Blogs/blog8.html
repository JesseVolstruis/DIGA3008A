        <p><cite>Digital inequalities in the age of artificial intelligence and big data </cite> by Christoph Lutz</p>

        <p>
            Lutz introduces the concept of digital inequalities and that they're not just about access to technology but also 
            refer to issues more deeply intertwined social inequalities like class, race, and gender. He notes that early digital 
            inequality research focused on internet access and skills, revealing that disadvantaged groups remain disadvantaged online. 
            This article refers to 3 levels: access to technology, digital skills and use, and outcomes and benefits from technology. 
            Lutz points out that as new technologies like AI, big data, and algorithms emerge, digital inequality research have had 
            less presence in the discussion. This introduction resonates with how quickly technological narratives can leave social voices underrepresented. 
            Lutz's concern about digital inequalities research is important, as if we don't examine who benefits from or is harmed by 
            AI and big data, we may continue reinforcing oppression. It's not just about joining the conversation but changing it, 
            making sure digital equality is a central concern. His mentioning of needing an open approach also reflects a growing need 
            in academics about not only questioning technology but examining why we use it and who it serves.

        <h4>First level divide:</h4>

        <p>
            The first level divide refers to disparities in access to the internet originally focused on who could and 
            couldn't connect to new technologies. Significant access gaps were revealed among different demographics. 
            While divides in wealthier locations (like the U.S) have narrowed as availability grew, some other divides persist 
            especially in rural areas. Overall, access is still unequal. While internet access is becoming more widespread, access no 
            longer just refers to connection but about how people connect and what they can do online such as mobile users having 
            smaller screens and slower speeds. I agree with access not being equal even with widespread internet. 
            The comments about mobile access being second-class internet access is also emphasized in the reading. 
            These technologies can also deepen the divide. An example would be a community pushed towards mobile internet access 
            falling behind because of a potentially inferior way of accessing the internet. This could undermine the ideals of the 
            internet as an open and participatory space.
        </p>

        <h4>Second level divide:</h4>

        <p>
            The second level divide shifts the focus away from simply accessing the internet, nut 
            focuses on what people do with that access or their skills. Research examined the differences in digital skill 
            between along various factors such as: age, gender, education level. Some studies found that young, educated men are 
            among the more active internet users. Research also reveals divisions relating to participation such as creating content or 
            engaging in discussion. Age seems to be a string factor in determining participation. Additionally certain platforms seem 
            to be gendered reinforcing the social divide. I think that while access alone speaks about social inequality, it is further 
            reinforced by examining what people can do with that access, what they can gain. I see the second divide as deeper kind of 
            inequality, one that's built on preexisting power structures.
        </p>

        <h4>Third level divide:</h4>

        <p>
            The third level divide focuses on the outcomes people experience on the internet even with relatively equal access and 
            usage skills. These can be economic outcomes, social, or health related. This divide is shaped by user's skills, attitude, 
            and the types of online activities they do. Age also plays a factor but with less consistent effects. It is important to 
            analyse both benefits and harms of internet use. The third divide includes not only those who benefit, but also who is 
            more exposed to risk which can affect some online communities more greatly than others. I think that the third divide 
            only reinforces the idea that the internet is not inherently empowering but rather, only amplifies certain existing 
            social structures. The wealthy and well educated are more likely to reap the benefits of the internet where vulnerable 
            groups remain as such.
