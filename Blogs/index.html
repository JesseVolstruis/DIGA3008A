      <h3>Github:</h3>

      Although I have a small bit of prior experience with Github, I am not
      familiar enough with how it works currently. Setting it up and publishing
      to pages was fairly simple and I’m excited for how my experience with
      Github will progress as I get more comfortable using it. It seems very
      useful, especially since I’m interested in game development. In order to
      increase my efficiency with collaborative coding and programming in
      general, it’s best that I put in the proper effort to understand how
      Github works.

      <h3>Readings:</h3>

      Berners-Lee et al. Reading this article gave me insight into the earlier
      developments of the world wide web as we know it. The web and its sites
      have become deeply ingrained in a lot of society and some people, myself
      included, can so easily take for granted how accessible the web and its
      information is. It’s fascinating to me that despite how complex the Web
      is, it is so simple to navigate. In its early development the web seemed
      to be mostly focused on compiling human knowledge. The original vision for
      the web was for scientists to share documents after all. However, the web
      has grown significantly since then. Today, while also hosting a vast
      amount of human knowledge, the web is also used as sources of
      entertainment and communication. The web has grown from being
      knowledge-centric to being multipurpose and being relevant in many aspects
      of modern life. It’s fascinating seeing the developments that were highly
      anticipated of the web in its early days, and seeing how many we have not
      only achieved, but surpassed, showing how we have advanced since the webs
      creation. The internet has greatly influenced my life, seeing as I use it
      very often for communication, education, and most predominantly
      entertainment. The dot com bubble While the dot-com bubble in many ways
      shaped the internet we experience today, I notice some parallels between
      this dot-com bubble and other bubbles we encounter online today such tech
      startups and crypto currencies. With crypto currency specifically I notice
      a similar focus on high valuations and hype-based cycles. The dot-com
      bubble also seems to have paved the way for tech giants such as Google and
      Amazon partly due to how they learned from the mistakes made during the
      dot-com era by focusing on sustainability rather than short term hype.

      <h3>Flash:</h3>

      This was an interesting read considering how little I had known about
      Flash considering their past relevance on the internet and how ingrained
      into my life the internet is. It’s fascinating seeing how the decline of
      Flash has led to an overall increase in security, performance and
      compatibility on the internet.

      <h3>Goals for this course:</h3>

      I would say my goals are to properly familiarize myself with Github. Since
      I plan on going into game development, collaborative coding is one of many
      things Github will help me with. Getting accustomed to it should benefit
      me. I also want to know more about the web, seeing as I spend a large
      amount of time on the internet and that it greatly impacts my life. I also
      want to become proficient with HTML and or Javascript as I think being
      proficient with them could be very beneficial for my future.

      <h3>Reading:</h3>
      
      <p>Moulthrop, S.</p>
      
      <p>After reading this I find it interesting how, for the most part, the
      internet today can contrast the original vision for hypertext. I also find
      interesting how hypertext was intended to empower individuals by
      decentralizing knowledge, however it become dominated by large
      corporations such as CNN and Yahoo. This is similar to the internet today
      with companies such as Amazon and Google controlling most traffic.
      </p>

      <p>
      It's also fascinating to me how despite parts of the web contrasting the
      original vision for hypertext, hypertext being envisioned as an
      interactive media driven by users has some truth. An example is Wikipedia
      and social media in general where the users themselves supply most of the
      content.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The concept of the “docuverse” being a connected decentralized space
      seemed to be true more so in the earlier days of the web with forums and
      blogs but over time has become more overrun with large platforms such as
      Google, Youtube, X (Twitter) that can limit information.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Moulthrop suggests that we may not have created a true revolution in the
      media. I can agree to some degree. In today’s internet social media
      algorithms determine what we see, leading to echo chambers and lessening
      discussion. I would argue that this does not line up with the revolution
      that is discussed.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Overall, it was an interesting read. I found it fascinating how the web
      has shifted from being so focused on sharing information to more
      controlled environments.
      </p>
      

      <h3>Folder structure:</h3>
      
      <p>
      My goal for my folder structure is to follow conventions to keep things
      organized and easy to access. I would say I keep my folders fairly
      organized, and I don’t plan on changing that. It’s also best to keep to
      conventions as it will be very useful when going into industry. It will
      undoubtedly be helpful when working with others in collaborative spaces. I
      also plan to keep my URL schemes similarly simple and organized, as well
      as following the best practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Wireframe:</h3>

    </figure>

    <p>
      My plan is for a fairly simple design that’s easily readable and navigable. Rather than a flashy or extravagant design,
      I intend to focus on simply displaying the important information front and center. The banner will most likely 
      be an introduction or the purpose of the site. The four buttons in the center will direct you to the corresponding section
      while the buttons along the bottom allow you to navigate to any section regardless of the current page you’re on.
      Nothing else is planned as I don’t want to over complicate anything at the current moment.	
    </p>

    <h3>Inspirational sites:</h3>

    <p>
      My main inspirations at the current moment have come from the work of past students, that way I can more easily identify 
      the relevant information to put on my site. In the future I plan to look at portfolios and CVs of people in the game development 
      industry and identify anything else relevant to my site.

      <h3>Site content and elements:</h3>

      <p>
        For my site’s content, I still haven’t progressed passed my idea for a simple website. The navigation 
        will most likely be very simple with some flashier styling to add some flavour and keep user’s interest while using the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting at the homepage, I expect this page to be the most enticing design wise as it’s the first thing users will see when visiting the site. As for the design itself, I haven’t thought of what exactly it should be. 
        It will most likely relate to myself in some way, but I suspect it will have to do with games as it’s my hobby and desired career path.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below the banner for the home page will most likely be a menu with all the sections of the site to choose from. (Blogs, design etc.) For blogs, it will most 
        likely be a column of the blog titles that users will scroll through. Clicking on a blog title will expand it to the full blog post.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the other sections, I don’t have any concrete ideas for those yet and most likely won’t until I have progressed enough. 
        My profile section will most likely be a profile picture with important links and a description.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each page will have some way of navigating to any page on the site. My initial plan for this is buttons at the bottom of each of each page that can be clicked 
        to navigate to any desired page, that way once the user is finished reading a page they can easily navigate to the next.
      </p>

      <h3>Folder structure:</h3>

      <p>
        The content above roughly lines up with my current folder structure. Although not much is currently integrated. Each page for the website has its own scripts, styles and images folder. 
        I don’t expect much to change until I am far more experienced with CSS and Javascript.
      </p>

      <h3>Progress:</h3>

      <p>
        In terms of progress, my website now has multiple pages that are linked via hyperlinks. 
        The home page has a header and some navigation in the form of 4 links to the other pages.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of now, only the blogs link functions and has its respective page. I haven’t added any of the blogs themselves to the page yet, as I was planning to do this once at a later date. 
        I will be doing this sooner rather than later to get a feel for how I want the actual design of the page to be later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently there is an image and video on the site, although these are placeholders and are just to practice 
        inserting images and videos onto the site and will be replaced with more relevant content as time goes on.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also cleaned up my folder structure as I prepare to add even more pages and eventually start using scripts and styles. 
        Each page of the site has its own folder, with each folder having its styles scripts etc.
