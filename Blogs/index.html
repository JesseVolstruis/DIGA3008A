        <h3>Github:</h3>

        <p>
          Although I have a small bit of prior experience with Github, I am not
          familiar enough with how it works currently. Setting it up and
          publishing to pages was fairly simple and I’m excited for how my
          experience with Github will progress as I get more comfortable using
          it. It seems very useful, especially since I’m interested in game
          development. In order to increase my efficiency with collaborative
          coding and programming in general, it’s best that I put in the proper
          effort to understand how Github works.
        </p>

        <h3>Readings:</h3>

        <p><cite>The World-Wide Web </cite>By Berners-Lee et al.</p>

        <p>
          Reading this article gave me insight into the earlier developments of
          the world wide web as we know it. The web and its sites have become
          deeply ingrained in a lot of society and some people, myself included,
          can so easily take for granted how accessible the web and its
          information is. It’s fascinating to me that despite how complex the
          Web is, it is so simple to navigate. In its early development the web
          seemed to be mostly focused on compiling human knowledge. The original
          vision for the web was for scientists to share documents after all.
          However, the web has grown significantly since then. Today, while also
          hosting a vast amount of human knowledge, the web is also used as
          sources of entertainment and communication. The web has grown from
          being knowledge-centric to being multipurpose and being relevant in
          many aspects of modern life. It’s fascinating seeing the developments
          that were highly anticipated of the web in its early days, and seeing
          how many we have not only achieved, but surpassed, showing how we have
          advanced since the webs creation. The internet has greatly influenced
          my life, seeing as I use it very often for communication, education,
          and most predominantly entertainment. The dot com bubble While the
          dot-com bubble in many ways shaped the internet we experience today, I
          notice some parallels between this dot-com bubble and other bubbles we
          encounter online today such tech startups and crypto currencies. With
          crypto currency specifically I notice a similar focus on high
          valuations and hype-based cycles. The dot-com bubble also seems to
          have paved the way for tech giants such as Google and Amazon partly
          due to how they learned from the mistakes made during the dot-com era
          by focusing on sustainability rather than short term hype.
        </p>

        <h3>Flash:</h3>

        <p>
          This was an interesting read considering how little I had known about
          Flash considering their past relevance on the internet and how
          ingrained into my life the internet is. It’s fascinating seeing how
          the decline of Flash has led to an overall increase in security,
          performance and compatibility on the internet.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals for this course:</h3>

        <p>
          I would say my goals are to properly familiarize myself with Github.
          Since I plan on going into game development, collaborative coding is
          one of many things Github will help me with. Getting accustomed to it
          should benefit me. I also want to know more about the web, seeing as I
          spend a large amount of time on the internet and that it greatly
          impacts my life. I also want to become proficient with HTML and or
          Javascript as I think being proficient with them could be very
          beneficial for my future.

        <h3>Reading:</h3>

        <p>
          <cite
            >You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media </cite
          >By Moulthrop, S.
        </p>

        <p>
          After reading this I find it interesting how, for the most part, the
          internet today can contrast the original vision for hypertext. I also
          find interesting how hypertext was intended to empower individuals by
          decentralizing knowledge, however it become dominated by large
          corporations such as CNN and Yahoo. This is similar to the internet
          today with companies such as Amazon and Google controlling most
          traffic. It's also fascinating to me how despite parts of the web
          contrasting the original vision for hypertext, hypertext being
          envisioned as an interactive media driven by users has some truth. An
          example is Wikipedia and social media in general where the users
          themselves supply most of the content. The concept of the “docuverse”
          being a connected decentralized space seemed to be true more so in the
          earlier days of the web with forums and blogs but over time has become
          more overrun with large platforms such as Google, Youtube, X (Twitter)
          that can limit information. Moulthrop suggests that we may not have
          created a true revolution in the media. I can agree to some degree. In
          today’s internet social media algorithms determine what we see,
          leading to echo chambers and lessening discussion. I would argue that
          this does not line up with the revolution that is discussed. Overall,
          it was an interesting read. I found it fascinating how the web has
          shifted from being so focused on sharing information to more
          controlled environments.

        <h3>Folder structure:</h3>

        <p>
          My goal for my folder structure is to follow conventions to keep
          things organized and easy to access. I would say I keep my folders
          fairly organized, and I don’t plan on changing that. It’s also best to
          keep to conventions as it will be very useful when going into
          industry. It will undoubtedly be helpful when working with others in
          collaborative spaces. I also plan to keep my URL schemes similarly
          simple and organized, as well as following the best practices.
        </p>

        <h3>Wireframe:</h3>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Images/Wireframe_0.png"
            alt="Wireframe 0"
            width="350"
            height="350"
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          My plan is for a fairly simple design that’s easily readable and
          navigable. Rather than a flashy or extravagant design, I intend to
          focus on simply displaying the important information front and center.
          The banner will most likely be an introduction or the purpose of the
          site. The four buttons in the center will direct you to the
          corresponding section while the buttons along the bottom allow you to
          navigate to any section regardless of the current page you’re on.
          Nothing else is planned as I don’t want to over complicate anything at
          the current moment.
        </p>

        <h3>Inspirational sites:</h3>

        <p>
          My main inspirations at the current moment have come from the work of
          past students, that way I can more easily identify the relevant
          information to put on my site. In the future I plan to look at
          portfolios and CVs of people in the game development industry and
          identify anything else relevant to my site.

        <h3>Site content and elements:</h3>

        <p>
          For my site’s content, I still haven’t progressed passed my idea for a
          simple website. The navigation will most likely be very simple with
          some flashier styling to add some flavour and keep user’s interest
          while using the site. Starting at the homepage, I expect this page to
          be the most enticing design wise as it’s the first thing users will
          see when visiting the site. As for the design itself, I haven’t
          thought of what exactly it should be. It will most likely relate to
          myself in some way, but I suspect it will have to do with games as
          it’s my hobby and desired career path. Below the banner for the home
          page will most likely be a menu with all the sections of the site to
          choose from. (Blogs, design etc.) For blogs, it will most likely be a
          column of the blog titles that users will scroll through. Clicking on
          a blog title will expand it to the full blog post. As for the other
          sections, I don’t have any concrete ideas for those yet and most
          likely won’t until I have progressed enough. My profile section will
          most likely be a profile picture with important links and a
          description. Each page will have some way of navigating to any page on
          the site. My initial plan for this is buttons at the bottom of each of
          each page that can be clicked to navigate to any desired page, that
          way once the user is finished reading a page they can easily navigate
          to the next.
        </p>

        <h3>Folder structure:</h3>

        <p>
          The content above roughly lines up with my current folder structure.
          Although not much is currently integrated. Each page for the website
          has its own scripts, styles and images folder. I don’t expect much to
          change until I am far more experienced with CSS and Javascript.
        </p>

        <h3>Progress:</h3>

        <p>
          In terms of progress, my website now has multiple pages that are
          linked via hyperlinks. The home page has a header and some navigation
          in the form of 4 links to the other pages. As of now, only the blogs
          link functions and has its respective page. I haven’t added any of the
          blogs themselves to the page yet, as I was planning to do this once at
          a later date. I will be doing this sooner rather than later to get a
          feel for how I want the actual design of the page to be later.
          Currently there is an image and video on the site, although these are
          placeholders and are just to practice inserting images and videos onto
          the site and will be replaced with more relevant content as time goes
          on. I have also cleaned up my folder structure as I prepare to add
          even more pages and eventually start using scripts and styles. Each
          page of the site has its own folder, with each folder having its
          styles scripts etc.

        <h3>Design Section:</h3>

        <p>
          My Goal with the website is to showcase the necessary information but,
          presented in a way that reflects my interest and potentially my
          personality (sense of humour?). Another goal is to use this website as
          a starting point for constructing a CV of sorts, or any way of
          presenting myself for the purpose of a career. I want users to see my
          interests present themselves through my work. I want them to look
          through the sites content and get a good idea of who I am. My users
          would be anyone who wants to know more about me, what kind of work I
          do, and how I present my work. My target audience would be fellow
          people with an interest in game design and potentially future
          employers. (maybe on a refined version in the future) My content
          (outside of the course required components) would be my current and
          future work, as well as my information. My work would most likely be
          in the form of game design projects, game jams etc. My information
          would be links to important sites and contact info. I would also
          include the inspirations, ideas for the site’s design.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Images/Menu_example.png"
            alt="Early menu concept"
            width="300"
            height="150"
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Early concept for home page navigation menu. I am thinking of drawing
          heavy inspiration from older video game menus for my website as it
          represents one of my interests and is fitting for my career choice.
          This choice will influence my info structure. This menu offers the
          choice of page to navigate to along with a brief description of the
          page (maybe like item description from video games?) All the
          information is bundled together in this menu to emulate the style of
          video game menus. This would most likely be what the user interacts
          with after reading the header. The menu is made up of a drop-down, (or
          button. Haven’t decided yet) for navigation nodes, and a text box. The
          user would use this to get an idea about the pages and navigate to
          their desired page. (by clicking its respective button) So far, the
          plans for my websites interface elements are the aforementioned menu
          and a scroll bar to navigate the page vertically. Plans for the
          interface elements of other pages haven’t been refined yet.

            width="250"
            height="350"
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Since the previous wireframe, I have constructed a slightly refined
          version. Last time I made the mistake of forgetting a wireframe for
          mobile devices. This has been corrected. Overall, the general idea is
          the same with only minor differences between the PC and mobile layout.
          The navigation menu in the above wireframe is set to be replaced by
          the previously (video game styled) navigation menu. Other than that,
          the wireframe is quite simple, and so I don’t see anything to change
          yet. My wireframes still have room for improvement though, even though
          this one is quite a bit better than my previous attempt.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection on work:</h3>

        <p>
          Overall, I’m satisfied with the work I’ve done on my website so far.
          The html portion is decently intuitive and I’m beginning to fill the
          blog portion with its content. Navigation to and from certain pages
          has been implemented, as ell as minor additions such as an email link,
          and a photo. I am worried about design, as I usually struggle to
          envision things in my head and tend to design as I work. Planning and
          sketching aren’t as intuitive to me. Other than that, I’m eager to see
          how the website develops.
