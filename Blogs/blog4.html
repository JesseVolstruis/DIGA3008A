      <h3>Design Section:</h3>

      <p>
        My Goal with the website is to showcase the necessary information but,
        presented in a way that reflects my interest and potentially my
        personality (sense of humour?). Another goal is to use this website as
        a starting point for constructing a CV of sorts, or any way of
        presenting myself for the purpose of a career. I want users to see my
        interests present themselves through my work. I want them to look
        through the sites content and get a good idea of who I am. My users
        would be anyone who wants to know more about me, what kind of work I
        do, and how I present my work. My target audience would be fellow
        people with an interest in game design and potentially future
        employers. (maybe on a refined version in the future) My content
        (outside of the course required components) would be my current and
        future work, as well as my information. My work would most likely be
        in the form of game design projects, game jams etc. My information
        would be links to important sites and contact info. I would also
        include the inspirations, ideas for the site's design.
      </p>

        <img class="SubPageImage"
          src="Images/Menu_example.png"
          alt="Early navigation menu concept"
        />

      <p>
        Early concept for home page navigation menu. I am thinking of drawing
        heavy inspiration from older video game menus for my website as it
        represents one of my interests and is fitting for my career choice.
        This choice will influence my info structure. This menu offers the
        choice of page to navigate to along with a brief description of the
        page (maybe like item description from video games?) All the
        information is bundled together in this menu to emulate the style of
        video game menus. This would most likely be what the user interacts
        with after reading the header. The menu is made up of a drop-down, (or
        button. Haven't decided yet) for navigation nodes, and a text box. The
        user would use this to get an idea about the pages and navigate to
        their desired page. (by clicking its respective button) So far, the
        plans for my websites interface elements are the aforementioned menu
        and a scroll bar to navigate the page vertically. Plans for the
        interface elements of other pages haven't been refined yet.
      </p>
        <img class="SubPageImage"
          src="Images/Wireframe_2_PC.png"
          alt="Wireframe PC layout"
        />


        <img class="SubPageImage"
          src="Images/Wireframe_2_Mobile.png"
          alt="Wireframe mobile layout"
        />

      <p>
        Since the previous wireframe, I have constructed a slightly refined
        version. Last time I made the mistake of forgetting a wireframe for
        mobile devices. This has been corrected. Overall, the general idea is
        the same with only minor differences between the PC and mobile layout.
        The navigation menu in the above wireframe is set to be replaced by
        the previously (video game styled) navigation menu. Other than that,
        the wireframe is quite simple, and so I don't see anything to change
        yet. My wireframes still have room for improvement though, even though
        this one is quite a bit better than my previous attempt.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflection on work:</h3>

      <p>
        Overall, I'm satisfied with the work I've done on my website so far.
        The html portion is decently intuitive and I'm beginning to fill the
        blog portion with its content. Navigation to and from certain pages
        has been implemented, as ell as minor additions such as an email link,
        and a photo. I am worried about design, as I usually struggle to
        envision things in my head and tend to design as I work. Planning and
        sketching aren't as intuitive to me. Other than that, I'm eager to see
        how the website develops.
