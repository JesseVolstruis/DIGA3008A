      <h3>Site content and elements:</h3>

      <p>
        For my site's content, I still haven't progressed passed my idea for a
        simple website. The navigation will most likely be very simple with
        some flashier styling to add some flavour and keep user's interest
        while using the site. Starting at the homepage, I expect this page to
        be the most enticing design wise as it's the first thing users will
        see when visiting the site. As for the design itself, I haven't
        thought of what exactly it should be. It will most likely relate to
        myself in some way, but I suspect it will have to do with games as
        it's my hobby and desired career path. Below the banner for the home
        page will most likely be a menu with all the sections of the site to
        choose from. (Blogs, design etc.) For blogs, it will most likely be a
        column of the blog titles that users will scroll through. Clicking on
        a blog title will expand it to the full blog post. As for the other
        sections, I don't have any concrete ideas for those yet and most
        likely won't until I have progressed enough. My profile section will
        most likely be a profile picture with important links and a
        description. Each page will have some way of navigating to any page on
        the site. My initial plan for this is buttons at the bottom of each of
        each page that can be clicked to navigate to any desired page, that
        way once the user is finished reading a page they can easily navigate
        to the next.

      <h3>Folder structure:</h3>

      <p>
        The content above roughly lines up with my current folder structure.
        Although not much is currently integrated. Each page for the website
        has its own scripts, styles and images folder. I don't expect much to
        change until I am far more experienced with CSS and Javascript.
      </p>

      <h3>Progress:</h3>

      <p>
        In terms of progress, my website now has multiple pages that are
        linked via hyperlinks. The home page has a header and some navigation
        in the form of 4 links to the other pages. As of now, only the blogs
        link functions and has its respective page. I haven't added any of the
        blogs themselves to the page yet, as I was planning to do this once at
        a later date. I will be doing this sooner rather than later to get a
        feel for how I want the actual design of the page to be later.
        Currently there is an image and video on the site, although these are
        placeholders and are just to practice inserting images and videos onto
        the site and will be replaced with more relevant content as time goes
        on. I have also cleaned up my folder structure as I prepare to add
        even more pages and eventually start using scripts and styles. Each
        page of the site has its own folder, with each folder having its
        styles scripts etc.
