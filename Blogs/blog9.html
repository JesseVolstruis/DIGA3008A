        <h3>My code and colonialism:</h3>

        <p>
            Throughout this course I've learnt a lot about the divides and inequalities that exist on the internet such as access or 
            skills. I have also learnt much about the responsibilities we have as designers since our code can have such an impact 
            on the world around us. My code doesn't exist in a vacuum, it's shaped systems that are often capitalist and western in 
            structure, failing to account for other possibilities. Being ignorant of this can further contribute to the issue it's 
            supposed to solve. I have become more aware of designing for those without access to the latest technology and cutting-edge 
            connectivity. As a designer, I have a responsibility not only to design with inclusion in mind, but also to ask myself 
            who benefits from my code and who is still left vulnerable.
        </p>

        <h3>JavaScript:</h3>

        <p>
            My thought process with my JavaScript is to enhance the interactivity of my site and improve responsiveness and 
            improve the user experience. Something that's always in my mind when writing this code is how it affects the 
            responsiveness of my website, as well as how I should code in a way that is most accessible to everyone. 
            This includes features like a “to top” button appearing when scrolling my posts or potentially allowing users 
            to zoom in on images. Currently JavaScript has been used to implement visual flair such as static effects and 
            CRT screen flickering. A lot of thought has gone into designing these to be as unintrusive as possible while 
            still conveying the theme. Responsiveness is one of my priorities as I want my site to be as accessible as possible.
