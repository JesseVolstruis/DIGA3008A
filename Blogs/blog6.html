        <h3>Internet access as a right:</h3>

        <p><cite>Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</cite> by Kasapis</p>

        <p>This article argues that access to the internet is a necessity 
            rather than a luxury particularly in reference to COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. 
            This aligns with the values detailed by the Design Justice Network that technology infrastructure 
            and design should help marginalized communities and address systemic inequality. 
            I agree with this sentiment. 
            With work, education and healthcare services becoming more online in nature as time goes on, 
            it's important that as many communities have universal access to these essential services. 
            Those without access to the internet are excluded from many aspects of life in this regard which may only 
            deepen social inequality. If the government fails to provide equal access to these services to these marginalized 
            communities indirectly contributes to even more inequality, violating the 
            Design Justice principle that no one should be harmed by the systems and structures that are supposed to support them. 
            The legal recognition of internet access as a right is an important step but justice isn't just about recognition but also 
            action. Treating internet access as a justice issue rather than market one shifts the 
            conversation away from economics and more to human rights and equality. Efforts to improve this could be designing 
            connectivity solution with the targeted communities rather than just for the communities, 
            to have them participate in the design.

        <h3>The digital divide</h3>

        <p><cite>The Need for Global Internet </cite> by Daniolou</p>

        <p>
            This article discusses the global digital divide: 
            the concept of remote or economically disadvantaged communities facing a lack of access to various infrastructures. 
            This lack of access to these infrastructures limits economic growth, education and community participation. 
            I think that this issue is relevant especially when taking Design Justice into account Design Justice. 
            This is because those most affected by the design decisions are rarely the ones making the decisions. 
            These designs could be something like investing in rural property etc. As a result, 
            connectivity systems are far more beneficial for more urban communities. 
            As with above reframing this issue as a justice issue rather than economic one helps turn the conversation more 
            towards human rights. Once again, more collaboration is needed with the marginalized communities if we want to see 
            more certain change. Just recognizing these issues won't be enough. This could include locals participating in the 
            planning and use of these networks and services as suggested by the Design Justice Network. As well as 
            constructing infrastructure, it may also be worthwhile to dismantle structural barriers and elevate the voices of 
            people who are currently excluded.
