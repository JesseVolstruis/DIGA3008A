        <h3>Final reflection on website:</h3>

        <h4>Folder Structure:</h4>

        <p>
            I believe that my website's folder structure reflects its content structure. 
            Each page has its own folder containing its images and styling with some pages having a JavaScript file. 
            Subpages such as individual blogs, essays etc. are kept in the same folder as their index page. 
            This is done consistently across the site. This structure makes I easier to navigate these folders when 
            editing site content. Html, CSS, and JavaScript are kept separate for each page. Naming conventions are consistent 
            for the folder structure with the main html page of each folder being named index.html with subpages being named 
            differently (e.g. blog1.html etc.) to avoid confusion and simplify folder navigation when editing. Due to the consistent 
            structure and naming conventions, the site content is simple to expand and edit, providing a solid foundation for future 
            work. For this reason, as well as separation of concerns, I would say the site's folder structure is 
            effective and provides the website with a solid foundation.
        </p>

        <h4>Semantic Markup:</h4>

        <p>
            Regarding my website's semantic markup, consistency was my priority, that way, if a user could understand how it was 
            used on a single page, they could apply that understanding to the rest. I tried to use the most applicable semantic 
            markup and microformatting when constructing the site, such as not overusing div containers and ensuring that appropriate 
            containers were used. I additionally kept my class/id naming convention consistent both for me and for users. Since the 
            semantic markup is consistently used throughout the site, working on the site is made easier both when navigating the html 
            and editing it. With its consistency I believe the semantic markup is effective in expressing my site content while 
            remaining easy to edit and search. Much like the folder structure, consistency helps build a foundation that simplifies 
            future work.
        </p>

        <h4>Metadata:</h4>

        <p>
            I believe my metadata is effective in guiding browser interpretation of my cite. 
            Pages have sufficient titles, I list myself as the author of each page, descriptions are included regarding each 
            page's content and style sheets/JavaScript scripts are linked in the head of each page. I recognize that there might 
            be more to implement regarding metadata but what I have is sufficient in providing needed context for each page. 
        </p>

        <h4>CSS:</h4>

        <p>
            I made sure to avoid in line styling. No styling is done in html, making sure that each page's CSS file is 
            utilized for this. I would say that it's maintainable although in future I would use comments to separate larger 
            CSS files (such as main.css) into sections making searching for groups of styling easier. Regarding responsive layouts, 
            there are areas where I don't feel so strongly about layout adaptiveness although the site maintains its usability across 
            different layouts, ensuring that readability and responsiveness remains adequate. Early in the development process, 
            I didn't use units such as em and rem, instead using px. This made formatting the site much harder, and although 
            I did change most of it, it made fully reworking the spacing/scaling very difficult. In future I will pay much more 
            mind to proper scaling and spacing.
        </p>

        <h4>JavaScript:</h4>

        <p>
            I believe that I effectively made use of JavaScript to enhance the 
            functionality of my website and provide further interaction with users. Using JavaScript to 
            implement the noise effect upon switching pages helped enhance the theming of my website along side a CRT flicker 
            effect. Functionality such as to top buttons make navigation more user friendly, and the image overlay for viewing 
            subpage images helps enhance visibility, especially on mobile layout. The filter for my project list is easily scalable 
            and only becomes more effective the more projects are added to the list. One area I feel I didn't effectively use 
            JavaScript was for performance. Although I used it for site functionality, performance and responsiveness were not 
            addressed in my JavaScript implementation.
        </p>

        <h4>Reflection:</h4>

        <p>
            Overall, I would say I'm satisfied with the final version of my website. It has the foundation to be 
            further developed and continue to be a way to show off my works/interests. I am satisfied with its visual 
            representation despite my lack of any artistic skill. I feel that I conveyed the theme that I set out to do, 
            creating a somewhat unique website. Although I failed to investigate performance/responsiveness improvements, 
            I feel that I now have a better understanding of the fundamentals of web development. Being able to consider html, 
            CSS, and JavaScript from the beginning of the design process should improve future attempts at development.
