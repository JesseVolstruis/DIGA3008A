        <h3>An analysis on the ethics of Capitec Bank's UI/UX practices:</h3>

        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

        <p>
            UI and UX ethics play a key role in how users interact with websites. Due to the sensitivity of the services being provided,
            financial institutes such as Capitec Bank face certain ethical challenges with their web design. 
            UI and UX can be used to manipulate users in a variety of ways, the website should not only be functional, 
            but also responsible in how it uses UI and UX. This essay will analyse the UI/UX of Capitec Bank's website and the 
            ethics in its design choices. By analysing the site's use of principles regarding usability, transparency, accessibility 
            this essay will explore the user experience and underlying ethical choices in Capitec's website design. This analysis will 
            showcase Capitec's strengths and weaknesses in creating a user-friendly website as well investigating how it delivers its 
            digital service.
        </p>

        <h4>UI and UX analysis:</h4>

        <h4>Usability:</h4>

        <p>
            Regarding the website's home page, the usability of Capitec's website appears functional at a glance and displays 
            intuitive design in areas however, a user's experience with the site heavily depends on their pre-existing knowledge 
            of online banking. The page has a strong visual hierarchy. Large text displayed prominently on the page draws the user's 
            eye. This guides users to key buttons for downloading and switching to Capitec. The language used is simple and promotes 
            the company: “Imagine banking that works for you…”.  By making use of text and buttons that clearly stand out, Capitec 
            effectively displays its core mission and its key navigation buttons. (such as downloading the app and switching banks) 
            This is a positive use of Gestalt design regarding visual hierarchy and proximity [1]. The site uses the Von Restorff 
            Effect by using visual differences among the buttons to make certain options more visible. The contrasted buttons are 
            related to access [2]. However, the density of the content on the homepage may increase the cognitive load on users and 
            lead to confusion, especially those not familiar with online banking. This relates to Hick's law about the number of 
            choices affecting the decision-making time of users [3]. This shows that, while Capitec demonstrates ethical use of visual 
            hierarchy on its homepage, the density of its content can hinder usability if a user is not already familiar with online 
            banking.

        </figure>

        <p>
            Regarding the navigation, it is somewhat intuitive however, the quantity of navigation menus may be overwhelming. 
            The main navigation bar has four distinct options: Transact, Save, Insure, and Credit. These are visible without having 
            to scroll, as well as a secondary dropdown navigation menu under the “menu” tab. This reveals slightly more advanced 
            options: Investor relations, Media centre and Help centre. Additionally, there is a search bar to aid with navigation. 
            The presence of multiple navigation menus may lead to confusion and emphasize Hick's law regarding too many navigation 
            options. However, using the more concealed navigation menu for more advanced options is an effective use of the Progressive 
            Disclosure design principle where information is gradually revealed to reduce confusion. [4] By making use of these 
            techniques, the site's navigation does not actively hinder usability and are in line with ethical UI and UX practices 
            regarding clarity. However, due to the amount of navigation choices, users with less experience may suffer more cognitive 
            load and be less efficient.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            The login button is easy to locate at the site's top right corner. However, the button is understated compared to the 
            marketing related navigation options which could conflict with user's needs. The login button's location is a common 
            place for a login button on many sites and is predictable by users. The information presented to the user for logging 
            in is concise and asks the user whether it is a business account or personal account before asking for account number and 
            username. However, the login button does not stand out as much as the buttons promoting the app and the option to switch to 
            Capitec. The marketing related buttons have a contrasting background colour to their neighbouring buttons and stand out as 
            a result using the Von Restorff Effect [2]. The simple, linear login process promotes usability and is especially important 
            with a service as essential as banking however, the prioritization of marketing may conflict with this usability and reflect 
            negatively on the website's UI and UX practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            The site's mobile layout as well as choice of font promote accessibility but shares the same problems regarding user 
            experience. The mobile layout prioritizes the same information as desktop and is responsive with load times. 
            The main navigation bar is fixed to the bottom of the screen and is easily locatable. The dropdown menu is kept 
            at the top of the screen with its options intact. The login button is easily viewable at the top of the screen and 
            the same contrasting buttons are used for navigation options. By following the same design techniques in both the 
            mobile and desktop layout, there is no significant advantage in using one over the other. These options boost 
            accessibility lining up with ethical UI and UX principles.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the site has effective usability for experienced users, it may not be intuitive to those who are 
            unfamiliar with online banking. Banking is an essential and sensitive service. Because of this the site's 
            accessibility may suffer from design choices aimed at experienced users. This highlights how even well-designed 
            websites can raise ethical concerns when balance is not considered between demographics.
        </p>

        <h4>Transparency:</h4>

        <p>
            Capitec's website structure is effective in presenting its core functions. More complex content, such as interest rates 
            and eligibility requirements are not immediately viewable and clear which may hinder transparency. The core functions 
            according to the navigation bar and home page are: Transact, Save, Insure, and Credit. These are detailed further on the 
            page. Scrolling down gives a brief description of each of these functions. More complex options are contained in a 
            dropdown menu and require more clicks to access. While terms such as “Insure” and “Save” are easy to understand, 
            options such as “Social Impact” and “Media centre” have less immediate clarity and users may have a harder time 
            using the services outside of the four main options. However, revealing the more complex information gradually 
            rather than immediately is a responsible use of the Progressive Disclosure principle preventing users from becoming 
            overwhelmed [4]. These demonstrate an effective use of design principles regarding the transparency of the site's 
            navigation options. Providing clarity for its key services. Despite lacking immediate clarity, the site's more complex 
            navigation options are concealed as to not overwhelm users when balancing transparency and content density.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Figure 3: Descriptions of key services</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            While the website clearly presents key functions such as viewing fees, signing, and switching banks, 
            the option to open an account is not as accessible which may lead to user distrust. The homepage clearly 
            labels options essential in online banking. This can be seen in the option to view your fees and the option 
            to switch banks being prioritized over neighbouring buttons by making use of contrasting backgrounds. However, 
            the option to open an account can only be found near the bottom of most pages and is not as clearly presented. 
            This raises an ethical concern of purposefully de-emphasizing this essential action. This is an example of obstruction, 
            which involves deceptive patterns that delay or discourage user actions [5] This can negatively impact user trust and 
            the site's clarity.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the website's search bar can provide helpful results, the lack of suggested search terms and autocomplete can 
            hinder users in effectively searching for information. The search bar is useful in aiding confused users by providing 
            multiple results that contain your search query. However, there is a lack of varied suggested search options. Under 
            “popular searches” are three options regarding the mobile app. There is a lack in clarification between these three 
            options which may further confuse users. Additionally, there is no autocomplete or suggestion when entering search queries 
            which is a highly recommended feature of search usability [6].  This details a lack of balance between clarity and 
            marketing. With the marketing of the mobile app being prioritized over a more in-depth search function hindering 
            transparency.

        </figure>

        <p>
            Regarding the ethics in a financial context, Banking websites are ethically obligated to ensure their interfaces 
            are clear and promote trust [7]. Although the website has effective clarity with respect to its navigation options 
            and key services, the de-emphasis of the account opening option and priority on marketing the mobile app may dissuade 
            user trust and negatively impact the site's transparency. 
        </p>

        <h4>Accessibility:</h4>

        <p>
            Capitec's website has strong accessibility focused design in areas such as screen reader support, responsive mobile layout, 
            keyboard navigation, and readability. Capitec has stated their desire to improve accessibility regarding those with 
            impaired visibility and has collaborated with a blind computer programmer [8]. However, there is no explicit statement 
            on the compatibility with certain screen readers. The website supports keyboard navigation. Users can use tab to navigate 
            between interactable elements and the arrow keys can be used for scrolling. The presence of keyboard navigation lines up 
            with the global standard for digital accessibility [9]. The site uses a readable font with an above average font size. 
            The colours present on the website create an effective contrast when used for its interfaces. (for example, its buttons) 
            According to the WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool, no contrast errors are present [10]. These demonstrate ethical 
            use of accessibility in the website's design.
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

        <p>
            From the above we can see that Capitec's website shows a strong understanding of ethical UI and UX design. 
            This can be seen in its visual hierarchy and responsive layout. The design supports usability, clarity and 
            transparency with users who are already experienced with online banking. The site also promotes accessibility 
            through its use of readable fonts, clear contrast, and option for keyboard navigation. However, the website's 
            priority of marketing the mobile app over transparency in some areas such as account creation and search usability, 
            as well as being potentially confusing and overwhelming for inexperienced bankers presents ethical concerns that may 
            negatively impact user trust and site clarity which play essential roles in financial services. Overall while Capitec's 
            site is largely responsible in its use of UI and UX, it lacks polish and refinement some of its ethical practices 
            regarding transparency and usability.
