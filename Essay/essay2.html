        <h3>Digital Coloniality and Geopolitical Narratives in the Gulf of America Incident:</h3>

        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

        <p>
            The internet, whether it be in its earlier days or today, is greatly influenced by geography. We can see this with 
            geopolitical influence. Geopolitical influence is determined by power, and one way power can be gained is by using 
            digital infrastructure, algorithms and online platforms to spread influence. As digital infrastructures continue to 
            influence how people view and interact with the world, it becomes increasingly important who controls these technologies. 
            A recent example is Google Maps' renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America for some U.S. 
            users that occurred in 2024. This change in name sparked controversy across social media. This includes Mexico's 
            president Claudia Sheinbaum contesting this change [1]. Additionally, critics describe this as an act of digital 
            colonialism [2].
        </p>

        <p>
            This essay will cover the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as a study of digital infrastructure, 
            geopolitics, and digital colonialism. Considering the theories on techno-colonialism [3], the geographical 
            inequality of the internet [4], and writings on the digital divide and social hierarchies [5], 
            the discussion will focus on the intersection of geopolitical narratives and digital platforms. 
            The internet is rarely neutral, rather it is heavily influenced by those with the necessary political and economic power.
        </p>

        <h4>Digital geography and control of narrative:</h4>

        <p>
            Digital maps, outside of their primary use, can be used for power. 
            Maps can shape how the public understands borders and space, giving maps the influence they have. 
            Even though the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is a seemingly small change, Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum 
            contested this change, claiming that “the US government did not have the right to rename the entirety of the Gulf 
            of Mexico, much of which is in international waters.” [1] Additionally, critics such as Medium saw this as a case of 
            digital colonialism claiming that it “not only disrespects Mexico's sovereignty but also threatens Google's cooperation 
            with the Mexican government, businesses, and consumers.” [2] Online platforms such as Google Maps have a significant 
            impact regarding public geographical knowledge. By having control over names and representation, those who control 
            these platforms also control certain narratives. According to Greenstein et al., the internet reduces frictions of 
            geography, however benefits nations unevenly. This often reinforces existing inequalities [4]. The simple act of renaming 
            a body of water in this case, can be a geopolitical action. This is also true when the action aligns with the interests of 
            a certain nation. From this, we can see that digital maps can be used as a form of political influence. The renaming of 
            the Gulf shows how digital geography can shape the public's thoughts and identities.
        </p>

        <h4>Techno-colonialism:</h4>

        <p>
            Control over technology is related to colonialism, especially when the infrastructure is controlled by powerful people. 
            Techno-colonialism involves powerful states or corporations offering this technology in exchange for political 
            influence or access to data. According to G. Verdi, when nations rely on the U.S. or China for their technology and 
            infrastructure, they form a dependent relationship regarding these technologies. “This can be described as a 
            techno-colonial relationship, in the sense that centralized control and ownership of technology is used to exercise a 
            form of domination.” [3] Regarding the renaming of the Gulf, it showed how the U.S. and its corporations can impact public 
            narratives that align with the nation's interests and goals. For a platform such as Google Maps to be able to change the 
            name of a regional location (even if only to select users) shows how these platforms can be used for geopolitical 
            influence. The decision was in the hands of the U.S., not Mexico, who may feel the consequences for this action. 
            This dynamic of power and control reflects the technological relationship wherein control is often in the hands of 
            the Global North. Therefore, control over this infrastructure allows the geography of the world to be influenced by 
            those in power.
        </p>

        <h4>Digital divides and inequality:</h4>

        <p>
            Not every user has the same ability to respond to changes made on these online spaces. 
            This can be linked to the digital divide which describes the differences in skills, access, 
            and benefits gained from the internet and its uses. M.L. Ruiu and M. Ragnedda explain in their 
            writings about the digital divide that three levels exist: access to the technology, use of the technology, 
            and benefits associated with it [5]. Even if people have access to the internet, geography is still a factor. 
            Those from regions with less power and wealth have less of an ability to respond to changes or challenge narratives 
            made by those with greater power. In this case the people of Mexico and Latin America likely could not prevent the 
            change or properly participate in the discussion surrounding the decision. This reflects the reproduction of inequality, 
            where those with greater wealth are in more advantageous positions to use their voices on digital platforms. 
            Even if the internet appears neutral and open, existing hierarchies shape conversations and influence who has control or 
            dominance.
        </p>

        <h4>Digital Borders:</h4>

        <p>
            With the use of the internet, redrawing boundaries with more symbolic acts such as visibility, 
            renaming, and censorship allows these changes to happen with less physical conflict. These borders also 
            hold political power even though they are more often controlled by private corporations instead of states. 
            The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico shows how these borders can be changed while sidestepping certain international 
            processes. When Google Maps changed the Gulf's name, this was done without the agreement of other regions. 
            According to Greenstein et al., with the internet, the cost of spreading information is reduced however, 
            not all are benefit equally [4]. Those with power (in this case, tech companies) continue to enforce dynamics 
            relating to visibility and searchability. This can potentially be used as a form of censorship as well as continually 
            reinforcing existing social hierarchies.
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

        <p>
            The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico on Google Maps was more than just an adjustment. 
            It reflected the deeper relationships between digital infrastructure, geopolitics, and digital colonialism. 
            Through this essay, we see how digital infrastructure such as online platforms can influence the public's perception, 
            serve political interests, and further reinforce existing global inequalities. Theories surrounding techno-colonialism 
            and the digital divide emphasize that the internet is not an equal place. Rather it enforces existing hierarchies and 
            allows those in power to control borders, visibility and whose voices can be heard. This emphasizes how online spaces 
            can become an extension of political influence. As we further develop technology and digital infrastructure, 
            the internet becomes more essential to understanding the world. It is for this reason that greater accountability 
            is needed.
