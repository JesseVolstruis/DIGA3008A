      <h3>Wireframe 0:</h3>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Wireframe_0.png"
          alt="First wireframe"
          width="350"
          height="350"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        This wireframe was made before i had any prior knowledge of wireframing.
        Additionally, I wasn't sure of the direction to take my website in. The
        focus for this wireframe is the home page. I was focused on plainly
        presenting the most important information, that being the header and
        navigation to the other pages. Due to being the first wireframe, styling
        was not considered. I also neglected to consider other layouts besides
        desktop. Overall while this is a good starting point, more work needs to
        be done to solidify the vision for this site.
      </p>

      <h3>Wireframe 1:</h3>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Wireframe_1_PC.png"
          alt="Wireframe 1 for desktop layout"
          width="350"
          height="350"
        />
        <img
          src="Images/Wireframe_1_Mobile.png"
          alt="Wireframe 1 for mobile layout"
          width="350"
          height="450"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        These wireframes are simply cleaned up versions of the previous using a
        wireframe site to improve its visual quality. As far as differences go,
        I added another layout for mobile devices. I added a scroll bar on the
        side for improved navigation. At this point I had an idea on the theme
        for my website being styled after video games and their menus. For this
        reason I added drop-down that opens the main navigation menu. Generally,
        I still adhered to the idea of keeping navigation simple.

      <h3>Menu concept:</h3>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Menu_example.png"
          alt="Early Navigation menu idea"
          width="450"
          height="200"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        This is an early concept of what a navigation menu could look like. The
        main inspiration is a video game menu, specifically an rpg menu. Without
        fonts an colours it can be harder to convey but the plan is sharp
        shapes, (mostly rectangles) a dark blue colour scheme and an appropriate
        font. Potentially also icons that match the theme.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Menu_Inspo.webp"
          alt="Final Fantasy menu"
          width="300"
          height="200"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        The main inspiration for this design is one of FInal Fantasy's menus.
        The idea for the potential colour and font is also inspired by these
        types of menus. I like the colurs and block-like construction of the
        menu, although I dislike how cluttered it can look. Sometimes the
        information hierarchy can be confusing aswell. For my site, I will most
        likely be using similar colours and shapes, but different

      <h3>Practice style guide:</h3>

      <p>
        For the first practice for style guides, we were split into teams to
        design a style guide for a specific kind of website. The prescribed site
        was a South African skincare website with a focus on natural indigenous
        ingredients.
      </p>

      <h4>DESIGN GOAL:</h4>

      <p>
        Our website will showcase a minimalistic, clean aesthetic that
        prioritizes a user-friendly and engaging experience, that is easily
        navigatable. The website will display the products, through reflecting
        the richness of South Africa’s landscape.
      </p>

      <h4>DEFINING VISUAL AESTHETIC:</h4>

      <p>
        Our website will exhibit a minimalistic aesthetic, showcasing Blossom
        Beauty’s products, in a manner that is appeasing and easy to the eye.
        The focus of the website is to emphasize the organic ingredients of the
        products, which will attract our target audience. Our minimalistic
        colour palate will create an emphasis on the products to encapsulate
        their natural origin. These colours will be seen throughout the page, to
        create consistency, which will not overwhelm the user with change of
        colour aesthetic.
      </p>

      <h4>COLOUR SCHEME:</h4>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Test_Colour_Scheme.png"
          alt="Natural colour pallette"
          width="600"
          height="150"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        The website contains a neutral background which will emphasise the text
        and products, as there will be a contrast between the light background
        and dark text. With the use of different colours for boarders and
        headings, leads the viewers eyes through the website, without
        distracting them.
      </p>

      <h4>FONTS:</h4>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Test_Fonts.jpg"
          alt="fonts: Avenir Next LT Pro, Gill Sans Nova"
          width="300"
          height="300"
        />
