    <h2>Wireframes:</h2>

    <h3>Wireframe 0:</h3>

    <p>
      This wireframe was made before i had any prior knowledge of wireframing.
      Additionally, I wasn't sure of the direction to take my website in.
      The focus for this wireframe is the home page. I was focused on plainly presenting the most important information,
      that being the header and navigation to the other pages.
      Due to being the first wireframe, styling was not considered. I also neglected to consider other layouts besides desktop.
      Overall while this is a good starting point, more work needs to be done to solidify the vision for this site.

    <h3>Wireframe 1:</h3>

    <figure>
      <img src="Images/Wireframe_1_PC.png" alt="Wireframe 1 for desktop layout" width="350" height="350">
      <img src="Images/Wireframe_1_Mobile.png" alt="Wireframe 1 for mobile layout" width="350" height="450">
    </figure>

    <p>
      These wireframes are simply cleaned up versions of the previous using a wireframe site to improve its visual quality.
      As far as differences go, I added another layout for mobile devices. I added a scroll bar on the side for improved navigation.
      At this point I had an idea on the theme for my website being styled after video games and their menus. For this reason I added 
      drop-down that opens the main navigation menu. Generally, I still adhered to the idea of keeping navigation simple.
