      <h3>Wireframe 0:</h3>

          src="Images/Wireframe_0.png"

        <figcaption>Wireframe 0: First wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This wireframe was made before i had any prior knowledge of wireframing.
        Additionally, I wasn't sure of the direction to take my website in. The
        focus for this wireframe is the home page. I was focused on plainly
        presenting the most important information, that being the header and
        navigation to the other pages. Due to being the first wireframe, styling
        was not considered. I also neglected to consider other layouts besides
        desktop. Overall while this is a good starting point, more work needs to
        be done to solidify the vision for this site.
      </p>

      <h3>Wireframe 1:</h3>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Wireframe_1_PC.png"
          alt="Wireframe 1 for desktop layout"
          width="350"
          height="350"
        />
        <img
          src="Images/Wireframe_1_Mobile.png"

        />
        <figcaption>Wireframe 1: Improved version of first wireframe (Desktop and mobile layout)</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        These wireframes are simply cleaned up versions of the previous using a
        wireframe site to improve its visual quality. As far as differences go,
        I added another layout for mobile devices. I added a scroll bar on the
        side for improved navigation. At this point I had an idea on the theme
        for my website being styled after video games and their menus. For this
        reason I added drop-down that opens the main navigation menu. Generally,
        I still adhered to the idea of keeping navigation simple.

      <h3>UI concepts</h3>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Menu_example.png"
          alt="Early Navigation menu idea"
          width="450"
          height="200"
        />
        <figcaption>Concept 1: Navigation menu</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This is an early concept of what a navigation menu could look like. The
        main inspiration is a video game menu, specifically an rpg menu. Without
        fonts an colours it can be harder to convey but the plan is sharp
        shapes, (mostly rectangles) a dark blue colour scheme and an appropriate
        font. Potentially also icons that match the theme.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Menu_Inspo.webp"
          alt="Final Fantasy menu"
          width="300"
          height="200"
        />
        <figcaption>Inspiration 1: Final Fantasy menu</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The main inspiration for this design is one of FInal Fantasy's menus.
        The idea for the potential colour and font is also inspired by these
        types of menus. I like the colurs and block-like construction of the
        menu, although I dislike how cluttered it can look. Sometimes the
        information hierarchy can be confusing aswell. For my site, I will most
        likely be using similar colours and shapes, but different
      </p>

        <figcaption>Concept 2: Slightly improved navigation menu</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This is a slightly improved menu for navigating. 
        A drop down expands to a page selection. When an option is hovered over it becomes indented and a cursor appears. 
        This is a little bit of visual feedback for the menu. Visual clarity is very important with the menus as it aids in user friendliness. 
        Additionally, when hovering over an option, some text would appear in the box to the right, 
        whether it be a preview of the contents or a description. 
        This is still styled after a video game menu. Unfortunately, some menus in older games tend to be cluttered and confusing. 
        The text/description section is not final. A large block of text could clash with the simple, user friendly menus.
        This navigation would be present on every page with variations for other menus, such as my links etc.
        The navigation section to the left is to navigate on the page. This is an example for the blogs page. 
        In this case each button would navigate to its corresponding position on the page. 
        As for composition, I'm not sure about its placement. An idea would be to place the left navigation below the page navigation 
        section as to not mix up the two navigation menus. Overall the goal is still user-friendly simplistic menus which evoke 
        sense of video games.
      </p>

      <h3>Inspirations:</h3>

      <figure>
        <img src="Images/Menu_Inspo_2.webp" alt="JRPG Video game menu" width="300" height="200">
        <figcaption>Inspiration 2: Galv's RPG Maker</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        These early examples are primarily from Japanese Roleplaying Games, (JRPG) however the inspiration also extends to the modular 
        box-like menus in games in general (usually associated with older games. Newer games tend to have more elaborate menus)
        The focus and takeaway for my website is a user-friendly experience that displays the necssecary information while also
        being visually similar enough to video game menus to evoke that thought while navigating the website. 
        I want the website in general to convey in some sense that I am interested im game development. However the layout and colours
        from these games are very distinct. In future I may try to avoid styling my UI very close to my inspirations and rather go for 
        a more general type of box-like menu with some visual filter to convey the feeling im going for. A more subtle aesthetic 
        would be preffered as it would aid in the simplicity of the website and help keep navigation simple and intuitive.
        A more complicated menu would liekly be more difficult to navigate.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="Images/Stardew_Menu.png" alt="Screenshot Stardew Valley main screen" width="300" height="200">
        <figcaption>Inspiration 3: Stardew Valley main screen</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="Images/Inscryption_Menu.png" alt="Screenshot of Inscryption options menu" width="300" height="250">
        <figcaption>Inspiration 4: Inscryption options menu</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Examples of the box like structure but without a direct style inspiration. 
        Useful to study the visual hierarchy of these types of menus.
        If my plan for the JRPG inspired menus doesn't work out, 
        I will most likely pivot to a more general style such as Inscryption. (from the figure above)
        The benefits of this would be a less striking resemblence to an already existing property and more room to express myself with more 
        unique visuals. As far as the Inscryption menus go, I would mostly be looking at the visual style rather than layout,
        such as the thick lines, font and CRT TV screen filter. (Very likely to go with this as the site progresses)
        The menus I've designed previously would most likely be simplified to improve user friendliness. The box style and filter 
        would hopefully be enough to convey the theme while not adding to the complexity of the navigation.

      <h3>Practice style guide:</h3>

      <p>
        For the first practice for style guides, we were split into teams to
        design a style guide for a specific kind of website. The prescribed site
        was a South African skincare website with a focus on natural indigenous
        ingredients.
      </p>

      <h4>DESIGN GOAL:</h4>

      <p>
        Our website will showcase a minimalistic, clean aesthetic that
        prioritizes a user-friendly and engaging experience, that is easily
        navigatable. The website will display the products, through reflecting
        the richness of South Africa's landscape.
      </p>

      <h4>DEFINING VISUAL AESTHETIC:</h4>

      <p>
        Our website will exhibit a minimalistic aesthetic, showcasing Blossom
        Beauty's products, in a manner that is appeasing and easy to the eye.
        The focus of the website is to emphasize the organic ingredients of the
        products, which will attract our target audience. Our minimalistic
        colour palate will create an emphasis on the products to encapsulate
        their natural origin. These colours will be seen throughout the page, to
        create consistency, which will not overwhelm the user with change of
        colour aesthetic.
      </p>

      <h4>COLOUR SCHEME:</h4>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Images/Test_Colour_Scheme.png"
          alt="Natural colour pallette"
          width="600"
          height="150"
        />
        <figcaption>Test style guide colours</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The website contains a neutral background which will emphasise the text
        and products, as there will be a contrast between the light background
        and dark text. With the use of different colours for boarders and
        headings, leads the viewers eyes through the website, without
        distracting them.
      </p>

      <h4>FONTS:</h4>
