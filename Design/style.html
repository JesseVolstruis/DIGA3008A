          <h3>Style Guide:</h3>

          <h4>IxD process:</h4>

          <p>
            My Goal with the website is to showcase the necessary information but, 
            presented in a way that reflects my interests.
            My goal is also to focus on user-friendly navigation. The site will use an almost minimalisticstyle
            with simple menus to focus on user-friendliness. Text is ideally readable and doesnt strain the eyes.
          </p>

          <p>
            My users would be anyone who wants to know more about me, 
            what kind of work I do, and how I present my work. 
            My target audience would be fellow people with an interest in game design and potentially future employers. 
            (maybe on a refined version in the future)
          </p>

          <p>
            My content would be my current and future work, as well as my information. 
            My work would most likely be in the form of game design projects, game jams etc. 
            My information would be links to important sites and contact info. 
            I would also include the inspirations, ideas for the site's design.
          </p>

          <h4>Fonts:</h4>

          <figure>
            <img src="Images/New_Fonts_Neon.png" alt="Retro florar and sans serif" width="60%" height="60%">
            <figcaption>Fonts for website content</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Retro floral was chosen for its minimalistic and modern style. Its thick letters also worked nicely with the buttons
            giving the site a subtle box-like and video game menu feel. The very thick letters would also make the scanlines in the 
            final version. I initially expiremented with other fonts similar to standard neon signs but the text was very hard to read.
            Due to prioritizing user-friendliness, I opted out and went for an easier to read font. Sans serif is used for body text
            such as for the blogs and desing section. While basic, this is because the text is small and often in large blocks. 
            More elaborate fonts tend to be harder to read when in that format and strain the eyes. For readablility, that font was selected.
          </p>

          <h4>Colours:</h4>

          <figure>
            <img src="Images/Final_Colors.png" alt="Website colour palette" width="60%" height="40%">
            <figcaption>Colour palette for the website</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            These colours were chosen to pop against the black background to give off a neon aesthetic. They are used to make site elements
            such as header and buttons stand out. Blues are used for buttons whil organges are used for headers. All are very bright colours
            agaisnt a dark background making them very visible and easy to read. 
          </p>

          <h4>interaction points:</h4>

          <p>
            Each main page (all pages except individual blogs essays etc.) have a menu to navigate each page. 
            These can be used to access any desired page. 
            The pages without this navigation are: Individual blogs accessed from the blog page, sub sections for the design page, 
            and essays accessed from the essay page. 
            Instead, these pages will simply contain a button taking you back to the main page and buttons to navigate 
            to other sub sections.
            My profile page also has my links to find my work and my email to contact me. These open in new tabs in browser.
          </p>

          <h4>Buttons:</h4>

          <figure>
            <img src="Images/Button_Ideas.png" alt="Neon border buttons" width="60%" height="60%">
            <figcaption>Button concepts</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Box-like buttons with neon coloured borders. With the correct filter they could be used to construct menus
            that give off a video gamey feel in a slightly more subtle way than my initial ideas. Buttons alternate between
            the different blues for variety. Headings use similar boxes but in an orange colour.
          </p>

          <h4>User flow:</h4>

          <figure>
            <img src="Images/User_Flow.png" alt="User flow flowchart" width="100%" height="100%">
            <figcaption>User flow flowchart</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            This is a flowchart of user flow. All of this is just to indicate that the pages are all 
            connected except for the sub pages (the blogs, design sections and essays) as they can only be 
            accessed from their respective page. The goal is to prevent users from feeling lost. 
            Regardless of the page you're on, any desired page should be no more than 2 clicks away.
          </p>
    
            <h3>First ideas:</h3>
      
            <figure>
              <img
                src="Images/Menu_example.png"
                alt="Early Navigation menu idea"
                width="80%"
                height="35%"
              />
              <figcaption>Concept 1: Navigation menu</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              This was an early concept of what the navigation menu could look like. The
              main inspiration was a video game menu, specifically an rpg menu. 
              This was the first idea to suit the theme of the website however, the more I worked on potential menus, 
              the more the menus ended up becoming cluttered and complicated.
              I initially wanted to theme my site around video games as its one of my bigger hobbies and I'm interested in game design,
              however this was not what I ended up going with as my website's theme.
            </p>
      
            <figure>
              <img
                src="Images/Menu_Inspo.webp"
                alt="Final Fantasy menu"
                width="70%"
                height="55%"
              />
              <figcaption>Inspiration 1: Final Fantasy menu</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              This was the inspiration for the video game themed menu. What I liked was the font and the fact it related to video games.
              What I didn't like was the layout, and how the information could look clustered. The colour scheme is very specific and I
              was tunnel visioning on the idea. Overall while it was a start, the idea was too specific and making my own version would
              likely look too similar to the source material.
            </p>
      
            <figure>
              <img src="Images/Updated_Menu_Wireframe.png" alt="Improved menu wireframe" width="80%" height="60%">
              <figcaption>Concept 2: Slightly improved navigation menu</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              This was a slightly improved menu for navigating. 
              A drop down expanded to a page selection. When an option was hovered over it became indented and a cursor appeared
               to help with visual clarity and aid in user friendliness. 
              Additionally, when hovering over an option, some text would appear in the box to the right, 
              whether it be a preview of the contents or a description. I wasn't too happy with the idea. 
              A large block of text could clash with the simple, user friendly menus.
              This navigation would be present on every page so it needed to align with my goal for the site.
              The navigation section to the left was to navigate on the page. This was an example for the blogs page. 
              In this case each button would navigate to its corresponding position on the page. 
              This form of page navigation is still present, at least in concept.
              The initial goal was to present my website with a video game theme, 
              however I felt I might be coming off too strong on that front.
              My newer idea for the theme isn't as on the nose.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Current ideas:</h3>
      
            <p>
              The goal for my website used to be to showcase my connection to game development by theming my site around video games.
              My current idea is to use a neon aesthetic with scanlines. (CRT filter) 
              This way i could use a more minimalistic menu which would be easier to construct for me and eaier to navigate for users.
              This idea also wouldn't be as restrictive to work with and would allow a more subtle theme. The goal for this theme would be to 
              provide a user friendly experience that focuses on intuitive navigation with bright distinct visuals. 
              This wouldn't convey my connection to game development but I would leave that part to my profile and portfolio. 
              The visuals would simply be a way to present a minimalistic style in an aesthetic that I'm fond of. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Navigation is important as the users of my site are poeple who either want to know more about me or my works. 
              Providing an user-friendly experience is very important. People need to know how to access all the necessary information.
              With a focus on simple box-like menus, the navigation would focus on clarity with the neon visuals adding some flair 
              without distracting the user. (hopefully)
            </p>
      
            <h4>Sketches:</h4>
      
            <figure>
              <img src="Images/Neon_Menu_Home.jpg" alt="Neon styled sketch of homepage" width="65%" height="85%">
              <img src="Images/Neon_Menu_Blogs.jpg" alt="Neon Styled sketch of blog page" width="65%" height="85%">
              <figcaption>Design 1: Neon styled design for home and blog page respectivly</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              These are the inital sketches for how my sites first two pages would look. As per the goal above, the focus is on minimalistic
              box-like menus. For the homepage underneath the banner (maybe a logo too) is the navigation dropdown, revealing the buttons 
              for each pages navigation. Below that is the portfolio. My current idea is to diplay the game development projects I've done,
              with a way to navigate to that project's Itch/Git page. This would be the first thing users see, that way they immediatly know
              what I do. If they want more information then they would navigate to my profile. 
              For the blog page, the same dropdown menu (shown as collapsed) would be present. (aswell as on every other page)
              The blocks on the left side of the page would be used to navigate to an individual blog on the page. 
              This would be visible anywhere on the page so that users can quickly navigate to their desired point on the page.
              The blogs themself would take up the remainder of the page. 
              They would be written in grey/white as opposed to neon to improve readability.
              The blogs are large chunks of text and improving their readability is top priority.
              The neon buttons are used on a black background to make them stand out and clearly visible.
              The buttons are coloured in blues while other UI elements are marked on orange.
              This is to indicate what can be interacted with in order to prevent confusion and provide clarity.
              Although hard to see, scanlines are applied to these sketches to get an idea for the final product.
              The screen-like visuals can be a subtle way to reference my interests without being too direct.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Inspirations:</h3>

            </figure>
      
            <p>
              As with my first ideas, these are from video game menus. However, unlike before, these menus are less cluttered.
              As for what parts inspired me, with Inscryption being the exception, they are brightly coloured, they use a minimalistic
              box-like structure, and all 3 employ the scanlines. All 3 are visual styles I am very fond of, 
              my idea is to use their similarites as the basis of my style while emphasizing the bright colours aspect.
