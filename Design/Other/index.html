            <h3>Practice style guide:</h3>
      
            <p>
              For the first practice for style guides, we were split into teams to
              design a style guide for a specific kind of website. The prescribed site
              was a South African skincare website with a focus on natural indigenous
              ingredients.
            </p>
      
            <h4>DESIGN GOAL:</h4>
      
            <p>
              Our website will showcase a minimalistic, clean aesthetic that
              prioritizes a user-friendly and engaging experience, that is easily
              navigatable. The website will display the products, through reflecting
              the richness of South Africa's landscape.
            </p>
      
            <h4>DEFINING VISUAL AESTHETIC:</h4>
      
            <p>
              Our website will exhibit a minimalistic aesthetic, showcasing Blossom
              Beauty's products, in a manner that is appeasing and easy to the eye.
              The focus of the website is to emphasize the organic ingredients of the
              products, which will attract our target audience. Our minimalistic
              colour palate will create an emphasis on the products to encapsulate
              their natural origin. These colours will be seen throughout the page, to
              create consistency, which will not overwhelm the user with change of
              colour aesthetic.
            </p>
      
            <h4>COLOUR SCHEME:</h4>
      
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../Images/Test_Colour_Scheme.png"
                alt="Natural colour pallette"
                width="600"
                height="150"
              />
              <figcaption>Test style guide colours</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              The website contains a neutral background which will emphasise the text
              and products, as there will be a contrast between the light background
              and dark text. With the use of different colours for boarders and
              headings, leads the viewers eyes through the website, without
              distracting them.
