            <h3>Wireframe 0:</h3>
      
            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage"
                src="Images/Wireframe_0.png"
                alt="First wireframe: Early home page concept"
              />
              <figcaption>Wireframe 0: First wireframe</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              This wireframe was made before i had any prior knowledge of wireframing.
              Additionally, I wasn't sure of the direction to take my website in. The
              focus for this wireframe is the home page. I was focused on plainly
              presenting the most important information, that being the header and
              navigation to the other pages. Due to being the first wireframe, styling
              was not considered. I also neglected to consider other layouts besides
              desktop. Overall while this is a good starting point, more work needs to
              be done to solidify the vision for this site.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Wireframe 1:</h3>
      
            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage"
                src="Images/Wireframe_1_PC.png"
                alt="Wireframe 1 for desktop layout"
              />
              <img class="SubPageImage"
                src="Images/Wireframe_1_Mobile.png"
                alt="Wireframe 1 for mobile layout"
              />
              <figcaption>Wireframe 1: Improved version of first wireframe (Desktop and Mobile)</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              These wireframes are simply cleaned up versions of the previous using a
              wireframe site to improve its visual quality. As far as differences go,
              I added another layout for mobile devices. I added a scroll bar on the
              side for improved navigation. At this point I had an idea on the theme
              for my website being styled after video games and their menus. For this
              reason I added drop-down that opens the main navigation menu. Generally,
              I still adhered to the idea of keeping navigation simple.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframe 2:</h3>
      
            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Wireframe_2_PC.jpg" alt="Newer home page wireframe for desktop layout">
              <figcaption>Wireframe 2: Cleaned up home page</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              This wireframe factored in the inclusion of a portfolio to my homepage, as well as being slightly clearer than the previous
              wireframes. (improving is hard) As for a mobile layout, the navigation portion would be suitable, however the banners would be
              resized. The portfolio currently only has images (that will act as links to my works) and no text. 
              If text is included, it would be beside each image on desktop and below on mobile.
              This all lines up with the current goal of minimalistic menus and user-friendly navigation.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframe 3:</h3>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Wireframe_3.jpg" alt="Blog sub page early concept">
              <figcaption>Wireframe 3: Blog sub page sketch</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              Each blog has its own individual page with the header at the top for the blog number and its contents below. 
              In the wireframe the DropDown opens a list of all other blogs. Not shown in the user flow is the ability
              to navigate between all the blogs from the sub pages using this menu.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframe 4:</h3>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Wireframe_4.jpg" alt="Profile page early concept">
              <figcaption>Wireframe 4: Profile page sketch</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              Idea for the profile page. Outside of the standard navigationmenu present on all pages, the content includes 
              my profile image and a description about myself. Also included are my links such as my email, itchio and guthub.
              Initially, my projects were included but they were chosen to instead populate the home page.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframe 5:</h3>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Wireframe_5.jpg" alt="Blog main page sketch">
              <figcaption>Wireframe 5: Main page for blogs. Contains blog cards</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              A sketch for the main blog page. From this page you would navigate to individualblog sub pages by interacting
              with the cards. Present is the main navigation menu that appears on every main page. This same format would be used 
              for the design page and essay page, where the mian page has the main nav menu and cards that take you to sub pages.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframe 6:</h3>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Wireframe_6.jpg" alt="Blog sub-page sketch with new placement of navigation.">
              <figcaption>Wireframe 6: Sub-page for blogs. Contains in blog navigation.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              A sketch for each individual blog's page. It features the main navigation menu from the other pages,
              of which one of the buttons is a back buttonto return to the main blog page.
              Initially the buttons that allowed traversal between all the blogs were along the top below the main navigation.
              There was a problem with running out of space so I moved the menu to be a column along the side and made the text more
              narrow for better readability. The button for the blog you're currently on is shifted to the side for clarity.
              The heading directly above the blog also informs users which blog they're on. This same structure is also used for the 
              sub-pages.
            </p>

            <h3>Site features:</h3>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Wireframe_7.jpg" alt="To top button appears when scrolled far down">
              <figcaption>Wireframe 7: To top button appears when below the back button</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              A to top button for JavaScript. Used on longer pages. Autimatically appears when you scroll beneath the 
              back button. Clicking it takes you to the top of the page. Initially, there were to top buttons at the buttom of the page
              however, this wouldn't work for longer pages so I implenented this feature.
            </p>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Wireframe_8.jpg" alt="Image overlay sketch: an enlarged image with navigation buttons below">
              <figcaption>Wireframe 8: Sketch for image overlay deisgn and its navigation</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              This sketch is for the image overlay feature. When on a sub page (such as a specific blog or design section)
              you can tap/click on an image and have this overlay appear. The image will then (usually) enlarge for the overlay.
              The navigation below allows users to cycle through all the images on a given page. The button in the center closes
              the overlay. The text below each image tell users how many images are on each page and which image in the order
              you're viewing. This feature was included for better viewing of images, especially on mobile. There're also
              keyboard controls for those without a mouse. Using the arrow keys cycles images and escape closes the overlay. 
            </p>

            <figure>
              <img class="SubPageImage" src="Images/Wireframe_9.jpg" alt="Game recommendation sketch: Game name, store page image, description and link">
              <figcaption>Wireframe 9: Sketch for steam API game recommendation section</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              This sketch details the API implenentation. This is in the form of a steam API that is used to access my steam 
              library information to recommend games. Until the page is reloaded, this section will recommend a random game from my
              steam library as long as it has more than 20 hours of playtime. My website is themed around games (even if vaguely) so
              I wantedmy API implementation to link back to games. At first I considered asking users to input fields that would be
              used to recommend them a game, however I shifted my focus towards this current idea. My reasoning was that since this
              website was about me, I would recommend games that I like to give users a better understanding of my tastes. As for why
              I chose 20 hours of playtime as a factor, I wanted to make sure the games that can appear on the page are games that I
              enjoy and would recommend to others rather than any game from my library which could include games I don't play. Visually
              it uses the same elements that are used elsewhere on the site to maintain visual consistency. The elements for this section
              include the game's name, the banner from the storepage, the game's description, and a link to the game's steam storepage.
              This way a game is recommended and if users are interested from the banner and description, they can go directly to the
              storepage. Placeholder text is used for the name for when the results are loading and the image default is a static gif
              to further emphasize that the results are loading. Seperate text is used when the results fail to load as opposed to
              waiting for load.
