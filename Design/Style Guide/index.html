            </figure>
      
            <p>
              This was an early concept of what the navigation menu could look like. The
              main inspiration was a video game menu, specifically an rpg menu. 
              This was the first idea to suit the theme of the website however, the more I worked on potential menus, 
              the more the menus ended up becoming cluttered and complicated.
              I initially wanted to theme my site around video games as its one of my bigger hobbies and I'm interested in game design,
              however this was not what I ended up going with as my website's theme.

                height="200"
              />
              <figcaption>Inspiration 1: Final Fantasy menu</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              This was the inspiration for the video game themed menu. What I liked was the font and the fact it related to video games.
              What I didn't like was the layout, and how the information could look clustered. The colour scheme is very specific and I
              was tunnel visioning on the idea. Overall while it was a start, the idea was too specific and making my own version would
              likely look too similar to the source material.
            </p>

              <figcaption>Concept 2: Slightly improved navigation menu</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              This was a slightly improved menu for navigating. 
              A drop down expanded to a page selection. When an option was hovered over it became indented and a cursor appeared
               to help with visual clarity and aid in user friendliness. 
              Additionally, when hovering over an option, some text would appear in the box to the right, 
              whether it be a preview of the contents or a description. I wasn't too happy with the idea. 
              A large block of text could clash with the simple, user friendly menus.
              This navigation would be present on every page so it needed to align with my goal for the site.
              The navigation section to the left was to navigate on the page. This was an example for the blogs page. 
              In this case each button would navigate to its corresponding position on the page. 
              This form of page navigation is still present, at least in concept.
              The initial goal was to present my website with a video game theme, 
              however I felt I might be coming off too strong on that front.
              My newer idea for the theme isn't as on the nose.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Current ideas:</h3>
      
            <p>
              The goal for my website used to be to showcase my connection to game development by theming my site around video games.
              My current idea is to use a neon aesthetic with scanlines. (CRT filter) 
              This way i could use a more minimalistic menu which would be easier to construct for me and eaier to navigate for users.
              This idea also wouldn't be as restrictive to work with and would allow a more subtle theme. The goal for this theme would be to 
              provide a user friendly experience that focuses on intuitive navigation with bright distinct visuals. 
              This wouldn't convey my connection to game development but I would leave that part to my profile and portfolio. 
              The visuals would simply be a way to present a minimalistic style in an aesthetic that I'm fond of. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Navigation is important as the users of my site are poeple who either want to know more about me or my works. 
              Providing an user-friendly experience is very important. People need to know how to access all the necessary information.
              With a focus on simple box-like menus, the navigation would focus on clarity with the neon visuals adding some flair 
              without distracting the user. (hopefully)
            </p>
      
            <h4>Sketches:</h4>

              <figcaption>Design 1: Neon styled design for home and blog page respectivly</figcaption>
            </figure>
      
            <p>
              These are the inital sketches for how my sites first two pages would look. As per the goal above, the focus is on minimalistic
              box-like menus. For the homepage underneath the banner (maybe a logo too) is the navigation dropdown, revealing the buttons 
              for each pages navigation. Below that is the portfolio. My current idea is to diplay the game development projects I've done,
              with a way to navigate to that project's Itch/Git page. This would be the first thing users see, that way they immediatly know
              what I do. If they want more information then they would navigate to my profile. 
              For the blog page, the same dropdown menu (shown as collapsed) would be present. (aswell as on every other page)
              The blocks on the left side of the page would be used to navigate to an individual blog on the page. 
              This would be visible anywhere on the page so that users can quickly navigate to their desired point on the page.
              The blogs themself would take up the remainder of the page. 
              They would be written in grey/white as opposed to neon to improve readability.
              The blogs are large chunks of text and improving their readability is top priority.
              The neon buttons are used on a black background to make them stand out and clearly visible.
              The buttons are coloured in blues while other UI elements are marked on orange.
              This is to indicate what can be interacted with in order to prevent confusion and provide clarity.
              Although hard to see, scanlines are applied to these sketches to get an idea for the final product.
              The screen-like visuals can be a subtle way to reference my interests without being too direct.

            <p>
              As with my first ideas, these are from video game menus. However, unlike before, these menus are less cluttered.
              As for what parts inspired me, with Inscryption being the exception, they are brightly coloured, they use a minimalistic
              box-like structure, and all 3 employ the scanlines. All 3 are visual styles I am very fond of, 
              my idea is to use their similarites as the basis of my style while emphasizing the bright colours aspect.
