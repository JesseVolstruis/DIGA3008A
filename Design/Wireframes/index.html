            <p>
              This wireframe was made before i had any prior knowledge of wireframing.
              Additionally, I wasn't sure of the direction to take my website in. The
              focus for this wireframe is the home page. I was focused on plainly
              presenting the most important information, that being the header and
              navigation to the other pages. Due to being the first wireframe, styling
              was not considered. I also neglected to consider other layouts besides
              desktop. Overall while this is a good starting point, more work needs to
              be done to solidify the vision for this site.

            <p>
              These wireframes are simply cleaned up versions of the previous using a
              wireframe site to improve its visual quality. As far as differences go,
              I added another layout for mobile devices. I added a scroll bar on the
              side for improved navigation. At this point I had an idea on the theme
              for my website being styled after video games and their menus. For this
              reason I added drop-down that opens the main navigation menu. Generally,
              I still adhered to the idea of keeping navigation simple.

            <p>
              This wireframe factored in the inclusion of a portfolio to my homepage, as well as being slightly clearer than the previous
              wireframes. (improving is hard) As for a mobile layout, the navigation portion would be suitable, however the banners would be
              resized. The portfolio currently only has images (that will act as links to my works) and no text. 
              If text is included, it would be beside each image on desktop and below on mobile.
              This all lines up with the current goal of minimalistic menus and user-friendly navigation.
